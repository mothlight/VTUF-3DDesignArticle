Examining the role that increased tree cover and water availability can have on human thermal comfort (HTC) is needed to help guide the development of thermally comfortable cities. To achieve this, a new micro-scale model,  VTUF-3D (Vegetated Temperatures of Urban Facets), has been developed by embedding the functionality of the MAESPA process-based tree model (Duursma and Medlyn, 2012) within the TUF-3D (Krayenhoff and Voogt, 2007) urban micro-climate model.  This innovative tiling approach allows the new model to account for important vegetative physiological processes and shading effects and provides detailed calculations of surface temperature, mean radiant temperature, and UTCI across urban canyons.
This study presents an overview of VTUF-3D and two evaluations of VTUF-3D. The first evaluation compares modelled surface energy balance fluxes to observations. The second compares spatial and temporal predictions of Tmrt and UTCI to two observed street canyons.  The VTUF-3D model is shown to perform well. Using this model, it is now possible to conduct further analysis to quantify the impact each individual tree can have on conditions in urban canyons.  Further, the model can help inform the optimal arrangement and quantity of trees to deliver improvements in HTC.
