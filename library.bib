abstract = {This paper explores the relationship of walk access distance to rapid rail transit (RRT) stations with personal characteristics and station context, specifically in regard to an operated RRT system in the city of Nanjing, China. Both descriptive analysis and regression analysis on the commuter survey are conducted to reveal the association. Descriptive analysis indicates that the walk access distance in the morning peak is longer than that in the afternoon peak. Young commuters walk farther to access to RRT stations than children and older people. The walk access distance decreases with increasing household income. Regression analysis, in particular, on the association between walk access distance and station context suggests that commuters walk farther to reach a terminal station but walk a shorter distance to arrive at a transfer station than to a typical station. The walk access distance to an elevated station is longer than that to an underground station, and an approximately 100-m distance premium does seem to exist. In addition, the radius of the pedestrian catchment area (PCA) of an underground RRT station is about 200{\^{a}}€“300 m longer than the PCA of bus rapid transit station. Implications of the present study include defining flexible rail transit station{\^{a}}€™s PCAs in estimating urban rail transit (URT) ridership at the station level, optimizing the house location and price premium analysis around URT stations, and identifying the opportunities for transit-oriented development in the PCA of rail stations.},

abstract = {The effects of artiﬁcial turf (AT) on the urban canopy layer energy balance, air and surface temperatures, and building cooling loads are compared to those of other common ground surface materials (asphalt, con- crete, and grass) through heat transfer modeling of radiation, convection, and conduction. The authors apply the Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3D (TUF3D) model—modiﬁed to account for latent heat ﬂuxes—to a clear summer day at a latitude of 338 over a typical coastal suburban area in Southern California. The low albedo of artiﬁcial turf relative to the other materials under investigation results in a reduction in shortwave radiation incident on nearby building walls and an approximately equal increase in longwave radiation. Consequently, building walls remain at a relatively cool temperature that is similar to those that are adjacent to irrigated grass surfaces. Using a simple ofﬂine convection model, replacing grass ground cover with arti- ﬁcial turf was found to add 2.3 kW h m22 day21 of heat to the atmosphere, which could result in urban air temperature increases of up to 48C. Local effects of AT on building design cooling loads were estimated. The increased canopy air temperatures with AT increase heat conduction through the building envelope and ventilation in comparison with a building near irrigated grass. However, in this temperate climate these loads are small relative to the reduction in radiative cooling load through windows. Consequently, overall building design cooling loads near AT decrease by 15{\%}–20{\%}. In addition, the irrigation water conservation with AT causes an embodied energy savings of 10 W h m22 day21. Locally, this study points to a win–win situation for AT use for urban landscaping as it results in water and energy conservation.},

abstract = {Noise maps based on sound pressure levels are limited in accurately representing how people perceive the sound environment. As a complementary approach to noise maps, soundscape maps can be useful tools for urban planning and design because they provide more information than conventional noise maps to reflect perceived acoustic environments. This study provides an overview of soundscape maps and explores the influence of spatial contexts on soundscapes in urban spaces. Physical, acoustic, and perceptual data were collected on sound environments in various urban areas in Seoul to create soundscape maps. Sound source types (traffic noise, human sounds, water sounds, and birdsongs), psychoacoustic parameters (loudness and sharpness), and perceived soundscape quality maps were generated and it was found that soundscape characteristics were varied in accordance with the primary functions of a space. Based on the collected soundscape data, global and local spatial regression analyses were conducted to examine the spatial autocorrelation on prediction on soundscape quality, and spatial dependency of soundscape quality was found in both models. In particular, a local spatial regression model based on geographically non-stationary relationships in variables was found to be more effective in understanding soundscape quality in multi-functional urban spaces. These findings could provide useful knowledge for soundscape planning strategies.},

abstract = {Tower CO2 flux measurements from 20 European grasslands in the EUROGRASSFLUX data set covering a wide range of environmental and management conditions were analyzed with respect to their ecophysiological characteristics and CO2 exchange (gross primary production, Pg, and ecosystem respiration, Re) using light-response function analysis. Photosynthetically active radiation (Q) and top-soil temperature (Ts) were identified as key factors controlling CO2 exchange between grasslands and the atmosphere at the 30-min scale. A nonrectangular hyperbolic light-response model P(Q) and modified nonrectangular hyperbolic light-temperature-response model P(Q, Ts) proved to be flexible tools for modeling CO2 exchange in the light. At night, it was not possible to establish robust instantaneous relationships between CO2 evolution rate rn and environmental drivers, though under certain conditions, a significant relationship rn = r0 ekT Ts was found using observation windows 7-14 days wide. Principal light-response parameters-apparent quantum yield, saturated gross photosynthesis, daytime ecosystem respiration, and gross ecological light-use efficiency, ?? = Pg/Q, display patterns of seasonal dynamics which can be formalized and used for modeling. Maximums of these parameters were found in intensively managed grasslands of Atlantic climate. Extensively used semi-natural grasslands of southern and central Europe have much lower production, respiration, and light-use efficiency, while temperate and mountain grasslands of central Europe ranged between these two extremes. Parameters from light-temperature-response analysis of tower data are in agreement with values obtained using closed chambers and free-air CO2 enrichment. Correlations between light-response and productivity parameters provides the possibility to use the easier to measure parameters to estimate the parameters that are more difficult to measure. Gross primary production (Pg) of European grasslands ranges from 1700 g CO2 m-2 year-1 in dry semi-natural pastures to 6900 g CO2 m-2 year-1 in intensively managed Atlantic grasslands. Ecosystem respiration (Re) is in the range 1800 {\textless} Re {\textless} 6000 g CO2 m-2 year-1. Annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) varies from significant net uptake ({\textgreater}2400 g CO2 m-2 year-1) to significant release ({\textless}-600 g CO2 m-2 year-1), though in 15 out of 19 cases grasslands performed as net CO2 sinks. The carbon source was associated with organic rich soils, grazing, and heat stress. Comparison of Pg, Re, and NEE for tower sites with the same characteristics from previously published papers obtained with other methods did not reveal significant discrepancies. Preliminary results indicate relationships of grassland Pg and Re to macroclimatic factors (precipitation and temperature), but these relationships cannot be reduced to simple monofactorial models. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The WBGT heat stress index has been well tested under a variety of climatic conditions and quantitative links have been established between WBGT and the work-rest cycles needed to prevent heat stress effects at the workplace. While there are more specific methods based on individual physiological measurements to determine heat strain in an individual worker, the WBGT index is used in international and national standards to specify workplace heat stress risks. In order to assess time trends of occupational heat exposure at population level, weather station records or climate modelling are the most widely available data sources. The prescribed method to measure WBGT requires special equipment which is not used at weather stations. We compared published methods to calculate outdoor and indoor WBGT from standard climate data, such as air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. Specific criteria for recommending a method were developed and original measurements were used to evaluate the different methods. We recommend the method of Liljegren et al. (2008) for calculating outdoor WBGT and the method by Bernard et al. (1999) for indoor WBGT when estimating climate change impacts on occupational heat stress at a population level.},

abstract = {Green infrastructure elements such as green roofs, walls and urban forests provide multiple regulating ecosystem services to the urban environment, including storm water management, heat island effect control, esthetic values and improvement of air and water quality. However, specific regulating services on urban microclimate at street level have not been widely quantified. This article analyzes the effects of green roofs and urban forests on urban microclimate, quantifying its potential for regulating ambient temperature in hot season in Mediterranean-continental climates. The results show a moderate effect of green roofs on the surrounding microclimate, but a larger contribution when combining it with vegetation at pedestrian level. This experimental study has identified the potential of the ground moisture content for microclimate regulation leading to alternative solutions for microclimate regulation based on permeable materials used for ground coverage in urban cores in combination with shading elements. The conclusion shows the potential of the green roofs, urban forests and porous-moist materials as a strategy for adapting urban ecosystems to the effects of climate change.},

abstract = {Drivers at multiple scales influence the management of trees, grass and other vegetation in residential yards. While significant attention has been paid to the varied drivers of residential lawn care and herbaceous vegetation, less attention has been directed at urban tree management on residential property, particularly at the finer household-scale. This study examines residents' tree planting and removal decisions in Mississauga (Ontario, Canada) to better understand the way household-scale actions shape urban forests. Analysis of survey responses and interviews indicate that residents are activity managing their trees. Tree planting and species selection decisions were primarily motivated by aesthetic preferences and maintenance concerns. Additionally, nearly all of the motivating factors identified by residents were related to personal preferences and site-level characteristics as oppose to the ecosystem services highlighted by many researchers and practitioners. Tree removal was most commonly motivated by poor tree health. However, underlying many residents' decisions were a lack of knowledge about tree care and species characteristics, which contributed to a number of healthy tree removals. Ultimately, residents' focus on aesthetics is out of alignment with municipal plans that are frequently based on ecosystem service provision, while desire for low maintenance trees and lack of tree care knowledge raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of the urban forest.},

The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.},

Efforts to enhance the role of long-term research in informing major environmental challenges would benefit from the development of metrics to evaluate impact; stronger partnerships among research sites, professional societies, decisionmakers, and journalists; and greater investment in efforts to develop, test, and expand practice-based experiments at the interface of science and society.},

abstract = {The role of the built environment in facilitating physical activity is well recognised. However, longitudinal studies into the effects of changes to the built environment on levels of activity and quality of life outcomes are lacking, especially for older people. This paper presents results from a longitudinal study of 'home zone' style changes to residential streets, designed to make streets more 'liveable' by reducing the dominance of vehicular traffic and creating shared space. The interventions were focused in deprived areas, where the changes followed an inclusive, community-led approach. The intervention sites were matched with comparison sites receiving no intervention. Whilst existing studies into the outcomes of home zone type interventions have tended to focus on tangible measures such as road casualties or traffic speeds, this study examines broader, self-reported behavioural (i.e. activity levels and perceptions), health and quality of life outcomes. Results were gathered pre-intervention in 2008 and then, post-intervention, in 2010 or 2011 for participants aged 65 or older. They show that interventions are associated with a significant improvement in perceptions of how easy it is to walk on the street near home. Participants also considered that they were significantly more active post-intervention. However, there was less evidence of positive change in health, quality of life, frequency of activities outdoors, time spent outdoors, or better social connectedness. One potential reason is that a greater time period post-implementation is needed for such outcomes to become manifest.},

abstract = {We tested the ability of a model to scale gas exchange from leaf level to whole-tree level by: (1) measuring leaf gas exchange in the canopy of 10 trees in a tall Eucalyptus delegatensis RT Baker forest in NSW, Australia; (2) monitoring sap flow of the same 10 trees during the measurement week; and (3) using an individual-tree-based model (MAESTRA) to link the two sets of measurements. Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance components of the model were parameterized with the leaf gas exchange data, and canopy structure was parameterized with crown heights, dimensions and leaf areas of each of the measurement trees and up to 45 neighboring trees. Transpiration of the measurement trees was predicted by the model and compared with sap flow data. Leaf gas exchange parameters were similar for all 10 trees, with the exception of two smaller trees that had relatively low stomatal conductances. We hypothesize that these trees may have experienced water stress as a result of competition from large neighboring trees. The model performed well, and in most cases, was able to replicate the time course of tree transpiration. Maximum rates of transpiration were higher than measured rates for some trees and lower than measured rates for others, which may have been a result of inaccuracy in estimating tree leaf area. There was a small lag (about 15-30 minutes) between sap flow and modeled transpiration for some trees in the morning, likely associated with use of water stored in stems. The model also captured patterns of variation in sap flow among trees. Overall, the study confirms the ability of models to estimate forest canopy transpiration from leaf-level measurements.},

The heat effect of the absorbed radiation flux densities is parameterised by the mean radiant temperature. This paper presents the physical basis of the RayMan model, which simulates the short- and long-wave radiation flux densities from the three-dimensional surroundings in simple and complex environments. RayMan has the character of a freely available radiation and human-bioclimate model. The aim of the RayMan model is to calculate radiation flux densities, sunshine duration, shadow spaces and thermo-physiologically relevant assessment indices using only a limited number of meteorological and other input data. A comparison between measured and simulated values for global radiation and mean radiant temperature shows that the simulated data closely resemble measured data.},

@article{Moniruzzaman2012,
abstract = {Walkability audits provide valuable information about pedestrian environments, but are time-consuming and can be expensive to implement. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to select sites for conducting walkability audits. The key idea is to estimate a model of travel behavior at the meso-scale level, which can be examined to identify locations where the behavior is under- and over-estimated. We conjecture that systematic under- and over-estimation can be caused by micro-level factors that influence the behavior. The results can be used to identify sites for walkability audits. The approach is demonstrated with a case study in Hamilton, Canada. A model of walk shares forms the basis of the site selection procedure. After identifying areas with higher and lower shares than predicted by the model we select a sample of neighborhoods for audits. Analysis of the results reveals elements of the local environment that associate with greater-than-expected walk shares. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model-based strategy can be used to better target limited resources, and produce valuable insights into micro-level factors that affect travel behavior.

abstract = {AbstractAs a mass transit mode, the metro attracts passengers from a vast area around its stations through various feeding modes such as walking and cycling. This catchment area is important in interchange planning, transit integration and implementation, and demand forecasting, but the conventional airline buffer greatly overestimates the service area. Moreover, other access modes such as cycling and bus have seldom been considered. It is significant to delineate service areas for multiple modes using the network distance. To this end, an approach of determining the access distances and delineating the service coverage for metro stations was established for multiple feeding modes using a network approach. The proposed method was applied to the Beijing metro based on a large survey sample of trip origins. Data on more than four thousand metro trips were collected in a field survey, and the trip origins were retrieved and visualized in a geographic information system (GIS).

abstract = {Fanger defined two physiological criteria that are basic requirements for people's perception of thermal neutrality and, eventually, thermal comfort. Mean skin temperature and evaporative heat loss are defined as functions of metabolic rate. The equations are derived from experiments in light clothing at or close to normal indoor climate. Relations between skin temperature and sweating on the one hand and thermal sensation and comfort on the other are well recognized; the precise description of the relationships vary and may differ from normal indoor environments to more extreme thermal stress. In moderately cold environments (around +10 degrees C) ISO/DIS 7730 and ISO/DIS 11079 prescribe significantly different responses. Evaluation of the rationale behind the comfort criteria and the basic heat transfer equations in the two models reveals some clear differences. By modification of the sweating criteria and some of the heat transfer equations, predictions become much more similar. It is concluded that the basic comfort criteria may apply also to moderately cold and cold environments, but must consider the complex heat transfer through multilayer clothing in a more adequate way. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The suggested, modified comfort criteria incorporated either in the PMV-index or in the IREQ-index, provide more realistic and reliable prediction of heat balance and conditions for comfort in cool and cold environments.},

First, the basic ability of CFD simulations to reproduce the evaporative cooling on a simplified small-scale water surface in a boundary layer was investigated. Next, the prediction accuracy of the vapor transport mechanism from a water surface within an array of building was evaluated. It was confirmed that the vapor transport mechanism influenced by the complex wind flow around buildings could be reproduced by the current CFD code within a given accuracy. Finally, a numerical analysis that combined CFD and radiative heat transfer analysis was conducted for predicting the thermal environment around an actual residential neighborhood with a pond. The results were compared to experimental data. The experimental air temperature distribution around the pond was qualitatively reproduced via CFD. The maximum temperature decrease induced by the water surface was approximately 2??C at the pedestrian level. For a wind velocity of approximately 3 m/s at a height of 10 m, the effect of the evaporative cooling propagates downwind over an unobstructed distance of 100 m.},

The abundance of giant Australian cuttlefish (Sepia apama, Gray 1849) eggs and environmental data were recorded at nine sites near Point Lowly, Spencer Gulf, South Australia, an area where the largest desalination plant in the Southern hemisphere is proposed. In addition, the effects of different concentrations of desalination brine on the growth, survival and condition of cuttlefish embryos were investigated. The primary egg-laying sites for the cuttlefish were in the vicinity of Stony Point (sites 4 and 3) and the area with the least egg abundance was on the eastern and western areas around Point Lowly (sites 9 and 7) where no eggs were found. The survival of embryos decreased with an increase in salinity, with no embryos surviving to full term in salinities greater than 50 per thousand. Mean weight and mantle length also decreased with increasing salinity. Besides elevated salinity, the brine also had increased concentrations of Ba, Ca, K, Sr and Mg relative to water near Point Lowly. Brine discharge from seawater desalination poses a potential threat to the unique spawning aggregation of the giant Australian cuttlefish, in the upper Spencer Gulf, South Australia.},

abstract = {Where urban planning is used to promote environmental sustainability, it has traditionally focused on reducing emissions from housing and traffic. However, cities are increasingly being recognized as consumption centers of the global economy, as the origin of demand, and as the point of termination for complex economic supply chains. Based on results produced by a hybrid life-cycle assessment model, which attributed the end-to-end emissions of supply chains to end users, consumption that is not related to housing or ground transportation was found to account for 30{\%} of regional greenhouse gas emissions on average. In highly urbanized areas, the figure was even higher, at 45{\%}. Furthermore, a literature review indicated that most environmental assessment tools for local city-level and subcity-level urban planning are neither able to identify the environmental impacts of personal consumption nor the relationships between urban structures and personal consumption. Thus, this study concludes that there is an apparent gap between the needs and the means of the regional environmental management of urban areas.},

abstract = {Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was measured at 30-min resolution over a 19-month period (September 28, 2000-April 23, 2002) from a nonirrigated pasture site in Florida, USA, using eddy correlation methods. The relative magnitude of measured ETa (about 66{\%} of long-term annual precipitation at the study site) indicates the importance of accurate ET a estimates for water resources planning. The time and cost associated with direct measurements of ETa and the rarity of historical measurements of ETa make the use of methods relying on more easily obtainable data desirable. Several such methods (Penman-Monteith (PM), modified Priestley-Taylor (PT), reference evapotranspiration (ET 0), and pan evaporation (Ep)) were related to measured ETa using regression methods to estimate PM bulk surface conductance, PT ??, ET0 vegetation coefficient, and Ep pan coefficient. The PT method, where the PT ?? is a function of green-leaf area index (LAI) and solar radiation, provided the best relation with ET a (standard error (SE) for daily ETa of 0.11 mm). The PM method, in which the bulk surface conductance was a function of net radiation and vapor-pressure deficit, was slightly less effective (SE=0.15 mm) than the PT method. Vegetation coefficients for the ET0 method (SE=0.29 mm) were found to be a simple function of LAI. Pan coefficients for the Ep method (SE=0.40 mm) were found to be a function of LAI and Ep. Historical or future meteorological, LAI, and pan evaporation data from the study site could be used, along with the relations developed within this study, to provide estimates of ETa in the absence of direct measurements of ETa. Additionally, relations among PM, PT, and ET0 methods and ETa can provide estimates of ETa in other, environmentally similar, pasture settings for which meteorological and LAI data can be obtained or estimated. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The effects of temperature and photosynthetically active radiation levels on photorespiration were investigated in Panicum milioides Nees ex Trin. and Panicum schenckii Hack., species known to have low photorespiration rates and other characteristics intermediate between C3 and C4 species. Comparisons were made with the C3 grass species tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). An increase in temperature from 20 to 35 C raised photorespiration from 7.3 to 10.2 milligrams per square decimeter per hour in tall fescue, but the increase in P. schenckii was less than 1 milligram per square decimeter per hour. Increases in temperature caused much less change in CO2 compensation concentration in P. milioides and P. schenckii than in tall fescue, values of 160 microliters per liter being obtained in tall fescue at 40 C compared to about 40 microliters per liter for P. milioides and P. schenckii. Photorespiration in P. schenckii increased by only about 1 milligram CO2 per square decimeter per hour as the photosynthetically active radiation level was raised from 100 to 2,000 microEinsteins per square meter per second. Loss of CO2 into CO2-free air actually decreased from 2.2 to 1.0 milligrams per square decimeter per hour as the radiation level was raised from 100 to 1,100 microEinsteins per square meter per second but tended to rise again at 2,000 microEinsteins per square meter per second. In contrast, photorespiration in tall fescue tripled with radiation level over the same range, reaching a maximum value of 7.2 milligrams per square decimeter per hour as determined by extrapolation of the CO2 response curves to zero CO2. The CO2 compensation concentration in tall fescue was nearly insensitive to photosynthetically active radiation above 140 microEinsteins per square meter per second but, in P. milioides and P. schenckii, it decreased from values of 69 and 62 microliters per liter, respectively, to values of 21 and 16 as the radiation level was increased from 50 to 1075 microEinsteins per square meter per second. Interpolation of CO2-response curves showed that an increase in photosynthetically active radiation level from 100 to 2,000 microEinsteins per square meter per second reduced the CO2 compensation value of P. schenckii from 38 to 19 microliters per liter. Data from these experiments indicate reduced photorespiration or a CO2-recycling mechanism in P. milioides and P. schenckii which causes apparent photorespiration to be nearly insensitive to temperature in the 20 to 35 C range and to decrease at high radiation intensities.},

@article{Purvis2000,
abstract = {The term 'biodiversity' is a simple contraction of 'biological diversity', and at first sight the concept is simple too: biodiversity is the sum total of all biotic variation from the level of genes to ecosystems. The challenge comes in measuring such a broad concept in ways that are useful. We show that, although biodiversity can never be fully captured by a single number, study of particular facets has led to rapid, exciting and sometimes alarming discoveries. Phylogenetic and temporal analyses are shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary processes that have shaped current biodiversity. There is no doubt that humans are now destroying this diversity at an alarming rate. A vital question now being tackled is how badly this loss affects ecosystem functioning. Although current research efforts are impressive, they are tiny in comparison to the amount of unknown diversity and the urgency and importance of the task.},

@article{Schmid1994,
abstract = {The spatial resolution of meteorological observations of scalars (such as concentrations or temperature) and scalar fluxes (e.g., water-vapour flux, sensible heat flux) above inhomogeneous surfaces is in general not known. It is determined by the surface area of influence or source area of the sensor, which for sensors of quantities that are subject to turbulent diffusion, depends on the flow and turbulence conditions. Functions describing the relationship between the spatial distribution of surface sources (or sinks) and a measured signal at height in the surface layer have been termed the footprint function or the source weight function, In this paper, the source area of level P is defined as the integral of the source weight function over the smallest possible domain comprising the fraction P of the total surface influence reflected in the measured signal. Source area models for scalar concentration and for passive scalar fluxes are presented. The results of the models are presented as characteristic dimensions of the P = 50{\%} source areas (i.e., the area responsible for 50{\%} of the surface influence): the maximum source location (i.e., the upwind distance of the surface element with the maximum-weight influence), the near and the far end of the source area, and its maximal lateral extension. These numerical model results are related directly to non-dimensional surface-layer scaling variables by a non-linear least squares method in a parameterized model which provides a user-friendly estimate of the surface area responsible for measured concentrations or fluxes, The source area models presented here allow conclusions to be made about the spatial representativeness and the localness (these terms are defined in the text) of flux and concentration measurements.},

The package includes automated processing of numbers and units, and the ability to control tabular alignment of numbers. A number of LaTeX packages have been developed in the past for format- ting units: SIunits, SIstyle, unitsdef, units, fancyunits and fancynum.

We estimate that humans appropriate 10 to 55{\%} of terrestrial photosynthesis products.

Improved estimates will require high-resolution global measures within agricultural lands and tropical forests.},

abstract = {Managers will tell you that the resource they lack most is time. If you watch them, you'll see them rushing from meeting to meeting, checking their e-mail constantly, fighting fires--an astonishing amount of fast-moving activity that allows almost no time for reflection. Managers think they are attending to important matters, but they're really just spinning their wheels. For the past ten years, the authors have studied the behavior of busy managers, and their findings should frighten you: Fully 90{\%} of managers squander their time in all sorts of ineffective activities. A mere 10{\%} of managers spend their time in a committed, purposeful, and reflective manner. Effective action relies on a combination of two traits: focus--the ability to zero in on a goal and see the task through to completion--and energy--the vigor that comes from intense personal commitment. Focus without energy devolves into listless execution or leads to burnout. Energy without focus dissipates into aimless busyness or wasteful failures. Plotting these two traits into a matrix provides a useful framework for understanding productivity levels of different managers. Managers who suffer from low levels of both energy and focus are the procrastinators: They dutifully perform routine tasks but fail to take initiatve. Disengaged managers have high focus but low energy: They have reservations about the jobs they are asked to do, so they approach them half-heartedly. Distracted managers have high energy but low focus: They confuse frenetic activity with constructive action. Purposeful managers are both highly energetic and highly focused: These are the managers who accomplish the most. This article will help you identify which managers in your organization are making a real difference--and which just look busy.},

abstract = {Current urban water management practices aim to remove stormwater and wastewater efficiently from urban areas. An alternative approach is to consider stormwater and wastewater as a potential resource substitute for a portion of the water imported via the reticulated supply system. A holistic view of urban water resources provides the framework for the evaluation of the demand for water supply, the availability of stormwater and wastewater, and the interactions between them. The water balance model (Aquacycle) developed in this study represents water flows through the urban water supply, stormwater, and wastewater systems. Its daily time step provides temporal distribution of the flows, and enables comparison of the different components of the urban water demand. Aquacycle was tested using data from the Woden Valley urban catchment in Canberra, Australia and found able to satisfactorily replicate its water supply, stormwater and wastewater flows.

@article{Vanos2012,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to implement current and novel research techniques in human energy budget estimations to give more accurate and efficient application of models by a variety of users. Using the COMFA model, the conditioning level of an individual is incorporated into overall energy budget predictions, giving more realistic estimations of the metabolism experienced at various fitness levels. Through the use of VO(2) reserve estimates, errors are found when an elite athlete is modelled as an unconditioned or a conditioned individual, giving budgets underpredicted significantly by -173 and -123 W m(-2), respectively. Such underprediction can result in critical errors regarding heat stress, particularly in highly motivated individuals; thus this revision is critical for athletic individuals. A further improvement in the COMFA model involves improved adaptation of clothing insulation (I (cl)), as well clothing non-uniformity, with changing air temperature (T (a)) and metabolic activity (M (act)). Equivalent T (a) values (for I (cl) estimation) are calculated in order to lower the I (cl) value with increasing M (act) at equal T (a). Furthermore, threshold T (a) values are calculated to predict the point at which an individual will change from a uniform I (cl) to a segmented I (cl) (full ensemble to shorts and a T-shirt). Lastly, improved relative velocity (v (r)) estimates were found with a refined equation accounting for the degree angle of wind to body movement. Differences between the original and improved v (r) equations increased with higher wind and activity speeds, and as the wind to body angle moved away from 90°. Under moderate microclimate conditions, and wind from behind a person, the convective heat loss and skin temperature estimates were 47 W m(-2) and 1.7°C higher when using the improved v (r) equation. These model revisions improve the applicability and usability of the COMFA energy budget model for subjects performing physical activity in outdoor environments. Application is possible for other similar energy budget models, and within various urban and rural environments.},

abstract = {With the widespread application of eddy covariance technology, long-term records of hourly ecosystem mass and energy exchange are becoming available for forests around the world. These data sets hold great promise for testing and validation of models of forest function. However, model validation is not a straightforward task. The goals of this paper were to: (1) review some of the problems inherent in model validation; and (2) survey the tools available to modelers to improve validation procedures, with particular reference to eddy covariance data. A simple set of models applied to a data set of ecosystem CO2 exchange is used to illustrate our points. The major problems discussed are equifinality, insensitivity and uncertainty. Equifinality is the problem that different models, or different parameterizations of the same model, may yield similar results, making it difficult to distinguish which is correct. Insensitivity arises because the major sources of variation in eddy covariance data are the annual and diurnal cycles, which are represented by even the most basic models, and the size of the response to these cycles can mask effects of other driving variables. Uncertainty arises from three main sources: parameters, model structure and data, each of which is discussed in turn. Uncertainty is a particular issue with eddy covariance data because of the lack of replicated measurements and the potential for unquantified systematic errors such as flux loss due to advection. We surveyed several tools that improve model validation, including sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, residual analysis and model comparison. Illustrative examples are used to demonstrate the use of each tool. We show that simplistic comparisons of model outputs with eddy covariance data are problematic, but use of these tools can greatly improve our confidence in model predictions.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Urban green infrastructure (UGI) has been increasingly promoted as a key measure to mitigate heat stress in cities caused by the urban heat island effect and climate change impacts, including climate variability and extremes. However, comparable information concerning the performance of different UGI types to moderate such impacts is mostly lacking. This creates serious challenges for urban planners who need to decide on the most effective measures while considering spatial and administrative constraints. This study investigates how different types and quantities of UGI, i.e. trees, green roofs, and green facades, affect pedestrian thermal comfort. The study was applied to high-density residential areas under current and future climatic conditions. Climate change will on average increase afternoon Physiological Equiva-lent Temperature (PET) values by 2.4 K; however, this could be vastly reduced by different UGI scenarios. Planting trees had the strongest impact with an average PET reduction of 13{\%} compared with existing vegetation. Trees shade open spaces and provide evapotranspirative cooling. Another valuable adapta-tion option is green facades, which have mitigating effects of 5{\%}–10{\%}. In contrast, the effects of green roofs were negligible. Our results indicate that increasing the share of green cover did not directly cor-respond to the magnitude of the PET reduction. Placing vegetation strategically in heat-exposed areas is more effective than just aiming at a high percentage of green cover. We conclude that our extensive comparative analysis provides empirical evidence to support UGI on the micro-scale and assists planners and decision-makers to effectively select and prioritise concrete measures to adapt to climate change.},

This paper reports on resident demographics, attitudes, and perceptions as they relate to mode choice in 14 suburban multifamily sites in Eugene, Oregon. Through site analysis and resident surveys, this study shows that residents of well-connected suburban multifamily housing developments walk or bike for nearly half of their trips to the local commercial area (LCA). In addition, residents of well-connected multifamily developments reported walking to their LCA 60{\%} more (one more trip per week) than residents of less-connected developments who took a similar number of total trips. Quantifying the degree to which site design, and specifically connectivity, makes a difference in residents' mode choice is a first step towards increasing the amount of active transportation in these areas. The results of this research provide planners and designers a basis for re-evaluating suburban multifamily site design and zoning codes.},

We conclude that the helmet law has been an effective road safety intervention that has lead to a 19{\%} (90{\%} CI: 14, 23{\%}) reduction in head injury to cyclists over its first 3 years.},

@article{Dudley1996,
abstract = {I used phenotypic selection analysis to test the prediction from functional and comparative studies of plants that smaller leaves and more efficient water use are adaptive in drier environments. I measured selection gradients on leaf size and instantaneous water-use efficiency (a measure of carbon gain per unit water loss) in experimental populations of Cakile edentula var. lacustris placed into wet abd dry environments in the field. Linear and nonlinear selection differed significantly between the two environments as predicted. WUE was selected to be higher, and leaf area was selected toward a small intermediate optimum, in the dry environment. There was also significant positive correlational selection on WUE and leaf size, suggesting that the optimum leaf size in the dry environment is greater for plants with high WUE. In contrast, neither leaf size nor WUE were selected in the wet environment, though larger leaves resulted in greater vegetative biomass. Path analysis of linear selection gradients found that WUE affected plant fitness primarily because it increased vegetative biomass, as suggested by the hypotheses about the function of physiological traits. These results were not only consistent with the functional hypotheses but also with the observed genetic differentiation in WUE and leaf size between wet and dry site populations.},

abstract = {A global warming of 2 °C is predicted to drive almost half the world's lizard populations to extinction. Urban heat island (UHI) effects may further exacerbate the impacts of climate change on organisms that are sensitive to small changes in temperature. Currently, the Phoenix metropolitan region in Arizona, USA, is an average of 3 °C warmer than the surrounding desert. With continuing urbanization and climate change, thermal stress will become an increasingly important facet of urban ecology in coming decades. The main objective of our study was to investigate which landscaping styles and microhabitat variables can most effectively reduce the surface temperatures experienced by lizards. Using a bare lot as a control, we placed copper lizardmodels with data loggers in several vegetation and irrigation treatments that represent the dominant backyard landscaping styles in Phoenix (grassy mesic with mist irrigation, drip irrigated xeric, unirrigated native, and a hybrid style known as oasis). Our lizard models recorded 6915 estimates of potential body temperatures.We showthat lizard activity time in summer was restricted to a few hours in un-irrigated native desert landscaping, while heavily irrigated grass and shade trees allowed for continual activity during even the hottest days. Shade, humidity, and sky view factor explained the majority of variation in temperature at a sub-meter scale. We suggest that maintaining the existing diversity of landscaping styles (as part of an ongoing UHI mitigation strategy targeted at humans) will be beneficial for lizards.},

@article{Frich2002,
abstract = {A new global dataset of derived indicators has been compiled to clarify whether frequency and/or severity of climatic extremes changed during the second half of the 20th century, This period provides the best spatial coverage of homogenous daily series, which can be used for calculating the proportion of global land area exhibiting a significant change in extreme or severe weather. The authors chose 10 indicators of extreme climatic events, defined from a larger selection, that could be applied to a large variety of climates. It was assumed that data producers were more inclined to release derived data in the form of annual indicator time series than releasing their original daily observations. The indicators are based on daily maximum and minimum temperature series, as well as daily totals of precipitation, and represent changes in all seasons of the year. Only time series which had 40 yr or more of almost complete records were used, A total of about 3000 indicator time series were extracted from national climate archives and collated into the unique dataset described here. Global maps showing significant changes from one multi-decadal period to another during the interval from 1946 to 1999 were produced. Coherent spatial patterns of statistically significant changes emerge, particularly an increase in warm summer nights, a decrease in the number of frost days and a decrease in intra-annual extreme temperature range. All but one of the temperature-based indicators show a significant change. Indicators based on daily precipitation data show more mixed patterns of change but significant increases have been seen in the extreme amount derived from wet spells and number of heavy rainfall events. We can conclude that a significant proportion of the global land area was increasingly affected by a significant change in climatic extremes during the second half of the 20th century. These clear signs of change are very robust; however, large areas are still not represented, especially Africa and South America.},

@article{Moriana2002,
abstract = {The leaf gas exchange of mature olive trees (Olea europaea L.) was characterized over a wide range of water deficits in the field during 1998, in Cordoba, Spain. Leaf photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gl) responded diurnally and seasonally to variations in tree water status and evaporative demand. In the absence of water stress, A and gl were generally high during autumn and low in days of high vapour pressure deficits (VPD). Leaf A varied between 0 and 2 µmol m−2 s−1 under severe water deficits that lowered the stem water potential ($\Psi$x) to −8{\textperiodcentered}0 MPa, but recovered rapidly following rehydration. Transpiration efficiency (TE) was curvilinearly related to VPD and not influenced by water deficits except in cases of severe water stress, where low TE values were observed at $\Psi$x below −4 MPa. Three models of leaf conductance were calibrated and validated with the experimental data; two were based on the model proposed by Leuning (L) and the other was derived from the widely used Jarvis (J) model. The L models performed better than the J model in two validation tests. The scatter of the predictions and the limited accuracy of all three models suggest that, in addition to the physiological and environmental variables considered, there are additional endogenous factors influencing the gl of olive leaves.},

abstract = {Nonconforming people and activities challenge municipal governments. Using the US city of West Hollywood, California, as a case study, this paper argues planning tools such as design interventions for commercial streets cannot intentionally include nonconforming people or activities. West Hollywood drew national attention when it incorporated in 1984 as a progressive city with unique demographics, most notably a high percentage of gay residents. In the subsequent decades, it became a more exclusive city of leisure and entertainment. This case study helps explain why the redesign of its commercial streets became more exclusive despite the city's continued progressive politics and commitment to diversity.},

abstract = {Potential influences on explaining walking distance from home to access public transport are investigated, including trip and demographic characteristics and public transport supply. In Sydney, Australia, people walk farther to the train than to the bus, the distributions of walking distances are different for each mode, and the trip and demographic characteristics of train and bus users are different. Given the decision to walk to public transport, demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, and labor force status and trip characteristics such as trip purpose, time of day and week, fare and ticket type, and trip duration are not significant in explaining walking distance to each mode of public transport. The mode of the public transport trip is the most important determinant of walking distance, reflecting the different supply and spacing of each mode. For instance, there are many more bus stops than train stations. The differences between train and bus users suggest that accessibility initiatives for public transport might not be the same for each mode.},

@misc{Lee2014,
abstract = {This study contributes to the literature on walkability measurement by proposing a hybrid auditing method that combines the efficiency of a GIS-based approach with the pedestrian perspective possible with Google Street View. The paper first reviews the various in-person and secondary source auditing methods that have been developed over the past decade. It then tests the feasibility of a GIS/Google Street View hybrid method against an in-person auditing method. The approach here is based on the Irvine-Minnesota Inventory (IMI), selecting 94 objectively measured items that were available and accessible using a combination of GIS and Google Street View. The goal was to test the degree to which some of the measures employed in IMI could be streamlined using GIS and Google Street View as data sources. It is concluded that the combination of information from Google Street View and updated GIS layers can be an effective way of obtaining physical environment data that is very comparable to in-person observation. Keywords: walkability; auditing methods; GIS; Google Street View; Irvine-Minnesota Inventory (IMI)},

abstract = {Vegetative enhancement in the form of tree planting has been found to be a highly effective strategy for cooling urban environments, yet as cities continue to warm, the suitability of urban environments for some tree species is changing with shifting hardiness zones. Trees are assigned to hardiness zones, which are based on the average annual minimum temperature that a species can thrive. In recent decades, human induced global warming has shifted the location of hardiness zones across the United States. Our study examines the historical range of {\~{}}200 common US tree species and how climate change-induced shifts in hardiness zones are affecting historical tree ranges in 20 highly populated metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with high rates of urban heat island growth over time. MSAs are areas with at least one urban area of 50,000 or more people and adjoining territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core. We found 6 of the 20 MSAs lost tree species, with the Atlanta (13.51{\%}) and Washington DC (3.61{\%}) MSAs suffering the greatest losses. If historical rates of hardiness zone migration continue, a simple projection exhibits {\textgreater}6{\%} average tree species loss across all MSAs in the study. As hardiness zones continue to migrate northward with climate change, heat island mitigation and other environmental management strategies employing green infrastructure must identify tree species that are likely to remain well adapted to urban climates many years into the future.},

abstract = {It is often claimed that evapotranspiration from urban trees can mitigate the urban heat island and adapt our cities to climate change; however, the relative effectiveness of different tree species has rarely been investigated. The current study addressed this shortcom-ing by comparing the growth and physiology of five commonly planted tree species: Sorbus arnoldiana, Crataegus laevigata, Malus 'Rudolph', Pyrus calleryana and Prunus 'Umineko'. The study was conducted between March and November, 2011 in eight different streets of Manchester, UK where trees had been growing for 6 years in the same growing conditions. The study showed that evapotranspirational cooling is closely related to the growth and stress tolerance of tree species. Of the species tested, Prunus 'Umineko' and P. calleryana were the fastest growing and Malus 'Rudolph' was the slowest growing. In general faster growing species showed higher leaf area index (LAI) and higher stomatal conductivity and so provided more cooling. However, Prunus 'Umineko' had surprisingly low cooling and showed signs of drought stress. P. calleryana showed up to 100 {\%} higher stomatal conductance than the other tree species. Combining the higher LAI and wider canopy, P. calleryana and C. laevigata provided cooling up to 2.2 kW tree −1 , 3 to 4 times of cooling to that of Prunus 'Umineko' and S. arnoldiana and showed no signs of drought stress. Malus 'Rudolph' showed stress tolerance but provided low cooling. Prunus 'Umineko' and S. arnoldiana with their thin and sparse canopy provided low cooling and showed susceptibility to urban stress.},

abstract = {Longitudinal elongation contributes most to leaf area expansion of grasses and its rate is known to be strongly affected by N. Our objective was to determine the effect of two N regimes (N-0 and N+) on the gradient of leaf tissue formation in meristems of two contrasting tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) genotypes. Proportions of epidermal, mesophyll and vascular tissue as well as intercellular air space were determined throughout the base of actively elongating leaves. The area of leaf transverse sections nearly doubled between the ligule and the distal end of the growth zone (about 30 min), and was mainly associated with lateral epidermal and mesophyll cell division in the proximal 5.0-7.5 min. Further increase in transverse area was due to the formation of intercellular airspace and transverse expansion of epidermal cells. Depending on genotype and N treatment the mesophyll, epidermis, vascular bundles and air space comprised 45-54 {\%}, 20-28 {\%}, 6-9 {\%}, and 17-21 {\%}, respectively, of transverse leaf area ill the distal part of the growth zone. After a slight increase close to the leaf base, the area of vascular tissue remained constant throughout the growth zone. The proportion of air space to mesophyll space was higher at N-0 than at N+ because mesophyll area was enhanced by N+ to a greater degree than by N,. In the genotype with slow leaf elongation, the increase in cross-sectional leaf area was due to an increase in both leaf width and leaf thickness, In the genotype which had faster leaf elongation and wider leaves, only leaf thickness was enhanced by N+.},

abstract = {Guided walks near a light rail stop in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, were examined using a 2 (gender) × 3 (route walkability: low- mixed-, or high- walkability features) design. Trained raters confirmed that more walkable segments had more traffic, environmental, and social safety; pleasing aes- thetics; natural features; pedestrian amenities; and land use diversity (using the Irvine-Minnesota physical environment audit) and a superior social milieu rating. According to tape-recorded open-ended descriptions, univer- sity student participants experienced walkable route segments as noticeably safer, with a more positive social environment, fewer social and physical incivilities, and more attractive natural and built environment features. According to closed-ended scales, walkable route segments had more pleas- ant social and/or environmental atmosphere and better traffic safety. Few gender differences were found. Results highlight the importance of under- standing subjective experiences of walkability and suggest that these experi- ences should be an additional focus of urban design.},

This paper starts by introducing the necessity of a holistic, integrated, and multidisciplinary approach to the concept of smart cities. Smart cities are evolving by the creation of tools that are application specific; therefore, European classification of smart city applications will be reviewed (as authors have used these criteria to classify the analyzed applications) and the relationship between the different European smart classification standards are analyzed. Moreover, in order to see how reality aligns with the theoretical concept of smart cities, the authors analyzed 61 applications from 33 smart cities distributed in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. From these, 16 specific applications from eight cities have been selected and described in detail so they provide an overview of existing tools in different application areas, as defined by European standards. After showing actual smart cities, the concepts and steps for building future smart cities are suggested in a conclusion.},

@article{Greene2016,
abstract = {With a growing number of people living in urban areas, city residents are more frequently exposed to stresses related to the built environment including elevated summer surface temperatures contributing to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This study examines the role of urban tree density in moderating surface temperature variation in a densely populated city (Toronto, Canada). By applying parallel aspatial (OLS) and spatial regression (GWR) approaches with satellite derived data describing tree canopy density and surface temperature, one dimension of tree canopy quality (i.e., canopy density) is shown to contribute directly to a reduction in the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect at a local scale. Though the model fit differed between the two regression approaches, both exhibited moderately strong explanatory power and demonstrated that observed surface temperature decreases in locations with increasing high-density and closed tree canopy. Study findings provide an empirical basis to recommend that municipal urban forest strategies embrace canopy quality metrics, such as increasing the density of existing urban forest stands, as a part of tree planting objectives seeking to effectively deliver temperature moderation as a valuable ecosystem service.},

@article{Sternberg2000,
abstract = {The ideas that inform urban design usually coalesce around contending approaches, each associated with one or two leading writers. This article finds that these approaches share an intellectual foundation: They implicitly acknowledge the "noncommodifiability" of the human experience across property boundaries. They share the view that good design seeks to reintegrate the human experience of urban form in the face of real estate markets that would treat land and buildings as discrete commodities. The great writers on urban design have more or less explicitly defended this intellectual position by appeal to the nebulous concept of the "organic." Rather than just asserting that everything is part of an organic whole, this article identifies the integrative principles through which urban environments can transcend commodification. These principles include good form, legibility, vitality, and meaning.Journal of the American Planning Association, Vol. 66, No. 3, Summer 2000, copyright American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.

abstract = {Recent debates in urban planning have centered on whether the cul-de-sac street form should be eliminated from the United States' topography. Critics argue that these closed-off streets force residents into their automobiles, reduce communal interaction, are difficult for emergency vehicles to traverse, and are not environmentally friendly. Developers, realtors, and homebuyers, on the other hand, clamor for these streets, which are private, quiet, and safe for raising children. Lacking from debates over the future of the cul-de-sac are systematic analyses assessing the social consequences of living on these streets. I utilized a quasi-experimental design to assess differences in residential social cohesion for residents of “bulb” cul-de-sacs, “dead-end” cul-de-sacs, and through streets. My data reveal that bulb residents experience the highest levels of attitudinal and behavioral cohesion, followed by dead-ends, then through streets. With planning debates about the future of the cul-de-sac currently takin...},

@article{Leuning1995,
abstract = {Gas-exchange measurements on Eucalyptus grandis leaves and data extracted from the literature were used to test a semi-empirical model of stomatal conductance for CO2 gSc=go+a1A/(cs-I) (1+Ds/Do) where A is the assimilation rate; Ds and cs are the humidity deficit and the CO2 concentration at the leaf surface, respectively; g0 is the conductance as A → 0 when leaf irradiance → 0; and D0 and a1 are empirical coefficients. This model is a modified version of gsc=a1A hs/cs first proposed by Ball, Woodrow {\&} Berry (1987, in Progress in Photosynthesis Research, Martinus Mijhoff, Publ., pp. 221--224), in which hs is relative humidity. Inclusion of the CO2 compensation point, $\tau$, improved the behaviour of the model at low values of cs, while a hyperbolic function of Ds for humidity response correctly accounted for the observed hyperbolic and linear variation of gsc and ci/cs as a function of Ds, where Ci is the intercellular CO2 concentration. In contrast, use of relative humidity as the humidity variable led to predictions of a linear decrease in gsc and a hyperbolic variation in ci/cs as a function of Ds, contrary to data from E. grandis leaves. The revised model also successfully described the response of stomata to variations in A, Ds and cs for published responses of the leaves of several other species. Coupling of the revised stomatal model with a biochemical model for photosynthesis of C3 plants synthesizes many of the observed responses of leaves to light, humidity deficit, leaf temperature and CO2 concentration. Best results are obtained for well-watered plants.},

@article{Silva2010,
abstract = {A zero-dimensional energy balance model was previously developed to serve as a user-friendly mitigation tool for practitioners seeking to study the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Accordingly, this established model is applied here to show the relative effects of four common mitigation strategies: increasing the overall (1) emissivity, (2) percentage of vegetated area, (3) thermal conductivity, and (4) albedo of the urban environment in a series of percentage increases by 5, 10, 15, and 20{\%} from baseline values. In addition to modeling mitigation strategies, we present how the model can be utilized to evaluate human health vulnerability from excessive heat-related events, based on heat-related emergency service data from 2002 to 2006. The 24-h average heat index is shown to have the greatest correlation to heat-related emergency calls in the Phoenix (Arizona, USA) metropolitan region. The four modeled UHI mitigation strategies, taken in combination, would lead to a 48{\%} reduction in annual heat-related emergency service calls, where increasing the albedo is the single most effective UHI mitigation strategy.},

abstract = {Stepwise increases in fluorescent illuminance, imposed as a single variable in a controlled environment, induced progressive stomatal opening in 8 plant species, as evidenced by a consistent decrease in leaf diffusion resistance (R(L)), ranging from 15 to 70 sec cm(-1) in darkness to about 1 sec cm(-1) at approximately 40 kilolux. The minimum R(L) values were the same for the upper and the lower epidermis, provided that stomatal density was adequate. Saturation illuminance was not achieved in any species; extrapolation indicates that 50 kilolux would bring about full stomatal opening (R(L) {\textless}/= 0.1 sec cm(-1)).In 4 species, reasonable agreement was obtained in a controlled environment between transpiration as measured by weight loss and that calculated from determination of (a) the difference in water vapor density from leaf to air, (b) the boundary layer resistance, and (c) the leaf diffusion resistance. This result confirms the physical validity of the resistance measurement procedure.},

Besides the walking interaction among pedestrians, the interaction between pedestrians and the built environment in which they are walking also have greatest relevance. Force-based models were compared with the other three major microscopic models of pedestrian simulation to demonstrate a more realistic and capable heuristic approach is needed for the study of the dynamics of pedestrians.},

@article{Tularam2007,
abstract = {This Critical Review on environmental concerns of desalination plants suggests that planning and monitoring stages are critical aspects of successful management and operation of plants. The site for the desalination plants should be selected carefully and should be away from residential areas particularly for forward planning for possible future expansions. The concerning issues identified are noise pollution, visual pollution, reduction in recreational fishing and swimming areas, emission of materials into the atmosphere, the brine discharge and types of disposal methods used are the main cause of pollution. The reverse osmosis (RO) method is the preferred option in modern times especially when fossil fuels are becoming expensive. The RO has other positives such as better efficiency (30-50{\%}) when compared with distillation type plants (10-30{\%}). However, the RO membranes are susceptible to fouling and scaling and as such they need to be cleaned with chemicals regularly that may be toxic to receiving waters. The input and output water in desalination plants have to be pre and post treated, respectively. This involves treating for pH, coagulants, Cl, Cu, organics, CO(2), H(2)S and hypoxia. The by-product of the plant is mainly brine with concentration at times twice that of seawater. This discharge also includes traces of various chemicals used in cleaning including any anticorrosion products used in the plant and has to be treated to acceptable levels of each chemical before discharge but acceptable levels vary depending on receiving waters and state regulations. The discharge of the brine is usually done by a long pipe far into the sea or at the coastline. Either way the high density of the discharge reaches the bottom layers of receiving waters and may affect marine life particularly at the bottom layers or boundaries. The longer term effects of such discharge concentrate has not been documented but it is possible that small traces of toxic substances used in the cleaning of RO membranes may be harmful to marine life and ecosystem. The plants require saline water and thus the construction of input and discharge output piping is vital. The piping are often lengthy and underground as it is in Tugun (QLD, Australia), passing below the ground. Leakage of the concentrate via cracks in rocks to aquifers is a concern and therefore appropriate monitoring quality is needed. Leakage monitoring devices ought to be attached to such piping during installation. The initial environment impact assessment should identify key parameters for monitoring during discharge processes and should recommend ongoing monitoring with devices attached to structures installed during construction of plants.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is evidence that greater neighbourhood walkability (i.e., neighbourhoods with more amenities and well-connected streets) is associated with higher levels of total walking in Europe and in Asia, but it remains unclear if this association holds in the Canadian context and in chronic disease populations. We examined the relationships of different walkability measures to biosensor-assessed total walking (i.e., steps/day) in adults with type 2 diabetes living in Montreal (QC, Canada).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants (60.5±10.4 years; 48.1{\%} women) were recruited through McGill University-affiliated clinics (June 2006 to May 2008). Steps/day were assessed once per season for one year with pedometers. Neighbourhood walkability was evaluated through participant reports, in-field audits, Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-derived measures, and the Walk Score{\textregistered}. Relationships between walkability and daily steps were estimated using Bayesian longitudinal hierarchical linear regression models (n = 131).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Participants who reported living in the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods completed 1345 more steps/day (95{\%} Credible Interval: 718, 1976; Quartiles 4 versus 1). Those living in the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods (based on GIS-derived walkability) completed 606 more steps per day (95{\%} CrI: 8, 1203). No statistically significant associations with steps were observed for audit-assessed walkability or the Walk Score{\textregistered}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Adults with type 2 diabetes who perceived their neighbourhoods as more walkable accumulated more daily steps. This suggests that knowledge of local neighborhood features that enhance walking is a meaningful predictor of higher levels of walking and an important component of neighbourhood walkability.},

abstract = {A 0.05° × 0.05° gridded dataset of daily observed rainfall is compared with high-quality station data at 119 sites across Australia for performance in capturing extreme rainfall characteristics. A range of statistics was calculated and analysed for a selection of extreme indices representing the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events, and their contribution to total rainfall. As is often found for interpolated data, we show that the gridded dataset tends to underestimate the intensity of extreme heavy rainfall events and the contribution of these events to total annual rainfall as well as overestimating the frequency and intensity of very low rainfall events. The interpolated dataset captures the interannual variability in extreme indices. The spatial extent of signiﬁcant trends in the frequency of extreme rainfall events is also reproduced to some degree. An investigation into the performance of this gridded dataset in remote areas reveals issues, such as the appearance of spurious trends, when stations come in and out of use. We recommend masking over areas of low station density for this particular gridded data. It is likely that in areas of low station density, gridded datasets will, in general, not perform as well. Therefore, caution should be exercised when examining trends and variability in these regions. We conclude that this gridded product is suitable for use in studies on trends and variability in rainfall extremes across much of Australia. The methodology employed in this study, to examine extreme rainfall over Australia in a gridded dataset, may be applied to other areas of the world. While our study indicates that, in general, gridded datasets can be used to investigate extreme rainfall trends and variability, the data should ﬁrst be subjected to tests similar to those employed here.},

abstract = {Halting the 'extinction of experience', the progressive disengagement of people with the natural world, is vital to human health and wellbeing and to public support for global biological conservation. Home to the majority of humanity, urban areas are the key for engaging people with nature, raising the crucial question of how cities should best be designed to facilitate these experiences. For the purposes of maintaining local biodiversity, intensive development within a small area (land sparing) has been shown to be better than extensive development over a large area (land sharing). Here, we investigated for the first time how different city forms affect people's experience of nature, measured in terms of their use of greenspaces. We selected five pairs of land-sharing and land-sparing study regions with different coverage by greenspaces within the city of Tokyo, central Japan and used a questionnaire survey to determine the use residents made of these spaces. We found the frequency of people's recreational use of urban greenspaces was higher in urban land-sharing than land-sparing regions. Moreover, satisfaction with local green environments was also higher in land-sharing regions. This suggests a potential conflict in the design of cities between the urban form that is most desirable for the direct protection of regional biodiversity, and that which best promotes people's nature experiences and the support for its wider protection. A strong emphasis on the advantages of land sparing may increase the separation of humans from nature, and further reduce public interest in, and awareness of, biodiversity and its benefits.},

Although$\backslash$ncycling is on the rise even in car-oriented cities and regions, the fear$\backslash$nof being involved in a crash is still the main obstacle to further$\backslash$nincreases in cycling market shares. The current study proposes the first$\backslash$njoint model of frequency and severity of cyclist-motorist collisions$\backslash$nwith the aim of unraveling the factors contributing to both the$\backslash$nprobability of being involved in a crash and, conditional on the crash$\backslash$noccurrence, experiencing a severe injury outcome.Method: A multivariate$\backslash$nPoisson-lognormal model with correlated autoregressive priors was$\backslash$nestimated on a sample of 5,349 cyclist-motorist crashes that occurred in$\backslash$nthe Copenhagen region between 2009 and 2013. The model considered the$\backslash$nlinks of the road network in the region as the unit of observation,$\backslash$ncontrolled for traffic exposure of nonmotorized and motorized transport$\backslash$nmodes, evaluated the effect of infrastructure and land use, and$\backslash$naccounted for heterogeneity and spatial correlation across$\backslash$nlinks.Results: Results confirmed the existence of the phenomenon of$\backslash$nsafety in numbers and added to the narrative by emphasizing that the$\backslash$nmost severe crashes are the ones most benefiting from an increase in the$\backslash$nnumber of cyclists. In addition, results argued that the construction of$\backslash$nCopenhagen-style bicycle paths would significantly contribute to$\backslash$nincreasing safety, especially in suburban areas where the speed$\backslash$ndifferential between cyclists and motorists is greater. Last, results$\backslash$nillustrated a need for thinking about cycling safety in intersection$\backslash$ndesign and reflecting on the importance of spatial and aspatial$\backslash$ncorrelation both within and between injury categories.Conclusions: The$\backslash$nfindings from this study illustrated how encouraging cycling would$\backslash$nincrease safety in relation to the phenomenon of safety in numbers and$\backslash$nhow, in turn, increasing safety would convince more people to cycle. In$\backslash$naddition, they suggested how the design of bicycle infrastructure should$\backslash$nnot only consider bicycle lanes but in particular focus on bicycle paths$\backslash$nwhere the number of conflicts and the stress for sharing the road are$\backslash$nhighly reduced and how thinking about road design should extend to the$\backslash$ngeneral level and include a discourse about safer intersections. Last,$\backslash$nattention should be given to the road design in the city center and to$\backslash$ntraffic management, because clearly safer traffic implies more cyclists$\backslash$nand, in turn, more cyclists imply fewer cars and less congestion.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effects of different urban planning scenarios on the thermal comfort of pedestrians in two districts of the city of Dresden. A total of three alternatives to reconstruct these districts were created by considering realistic approaches for urban planning projections in the next ten years. These alternatives include the development and densification of existing buildings as well as the greening of undeveloped areas or the reduction of existing green areas. Based on these planning alternatives, micro-meteorological conditions as well as bioclimatic indices within the chosen city districts of Dresden for a hot summer day were simulated with a combination of the 3D microclimatic model ENVI-met and the bioclimatic model Rayman. Using both, potential air temperature (T) and the bioclimatic index UTCI (Universal Thermal Comfort Index), spatial distribution at different times of the day, the cumulative thermal stress conditions at both exposed "receptor" points and on a virtual course of pedestrians through the inner city of Dresden, were analysed. Simulation results clearly show the local reduction of T and UTCI due to the shading effect of denser vegetation or building structures during the daytime. For example, a greening of an industrial wasteland locally reduces T and UTCI in the early afternoon of a hot and sunny summer day by up to 2 and 14 K, respectively. The same increase in T and UTCI can be found in non-shaded partitions of this area if it is sparsely rebuilt. At night, areas with widespread building placement show a higher T and UTCI (up to 1 and 4 K, respectively), and areas with dense vegetation are cooler (0.1 to 0.4 K) than open areas. Due to the small extension of modified urban structures, the mean effect over the complete area amounts to only a fraction of a degree at most. The simulation results demonstrate that a greening of urban wastelands has primarily positive effects (that means cooling) on thermal extremes during hot summer periods. A dense rebuilding causes similar positive effects during the daytime due to the generation of new shading zones as well as negative effects (warming) by night. For citizens occupying these city areas, the local effect of a modified urban structure could be more relevant than the mean effect over the whole city district. Based on these findings, modern approaches of city development should optimally combine green areas, shadow zones of large buildings and the maintenance of "street canyon ventilation".},

abstract = {AbstractUrban parks, an essential component of urban green infrastructure, are known for their multiple ecosystem services to the residents in the cities. Mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effects is one of such services. Scientific understanding on how park size and surrounding landscape pattern influence its cooling effect, however, remains poor. Using 39 parks in Shanghai, China, this paper aims to understand the relationship of land surface temperature (LST) with park size and the impacts of the surrounding landscape patterns on parks' cooling effect. The results show that the parks' LST decreased logarithmically with park size. There are nonlinear relationships between park sizes and their cooling effects. Large parks do not have advantages over small ones in the efficiency of cooling the surrounding environment. Both the class and landscape level patterns surrounding the parks influence the cooling effect. The proportion and dominance of urban land use types negatively affect park cooling effec...},

abstract = {The influence of urban green infrastructure on the indoor environment and the effects on human comfort and economic consequences are still unclear. This paper gives a systematic overview of the relationship, in terms of so-called 'ecosystem services', between urban green infrastructure and the indoor environment through a literature review in different disciplines. Urban green infrastructure (mainly trees, green walls and roofs) was found to contribute, both positively and negatively, to the indoor environment via the influence on the climate, energy use, air quality, sonic environment and aesthetic quality. Four main factors that influence these effects were identified, being vegetation characteristics, building characteristics (including layout and geometry), and geographical conditions. Although the reviewed papers have investigated the different ecosystem services on a wide range of space and time scales, the performance of urban green on the meso- and macro climate has received less attention than on the micro scale. Also direct effects of urban green infrastructure on indoor air quality and sonic environment were rarely studied. Another finding is that, whereas the modelling approach on climate regulation has been widely adopted by researchers throughout the world, empirical studies have mainly been performed in the USA. We also analysed the data found on economic implications. The economic effects of adjoining vegetation and green roofs on climate regulation provided energy savings of up to almost {\$}250/tree/year, while the air quality regulation was valued between {\$}0.12 and {\$}0.6/m2 tree cover/year. Maximum monetary values attributed to noise regulation and aesthetic appreciation of urban green were {\$}20 - {\$}25/person/year, respectively. Of course these values are extremely time- and context-dependent but do give an indication of the potential economic effects of investing in urban green infrastructure. Based on this review, we conclude that new methods, measurement instruments and field experiments are needed to improve empirically supported correlations and develop concrete recommendations for urban planning and design. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Data are analyzed at the Census Block Group levels using Spearman's correlation, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), and a spatial autoregressive model (SAR). Across all cities there is a strong positive correlation between UTC cover and median household income. Negative correlations between race and UTC cover exist in bivariate models for some cities, but they are generally not observed using multivariate regressions that include additional variables on income, education, and housing age. SAR models result in higher r-square values compared to the OLS models across all cities, suggesting that spatial autocorrelation is an important feature of our data. Similarities among cities can be found based on shared characteristics of climate, race/ethnicity, and size. Our findings suggest that a suite of variables, including income, contribute to the distribution of UTC cover. These findings can help target simultaneous strategies for UTC goals and environmental justice concerns.},

abstract = {Microclimatic conditions inside urban areas depend on the result of the interaction of the regional climate with the whole urban area and on the local characteristics of the urban development. Inadequate human thermal comfort conditions can affect quality of life and the use of public open spaces. In this study, outdoor thermal conditions are examined through three field campaigns in Bilbao in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Climate variables are measured in four different areas of the city in different regional climate conditions. Thermal comfort evaluation is undertaken by means of the thermal index PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature). Measurements are compared with estimated values derived from ENVI-met model. Results show that the differences between modelled and measured climatic variables can imply a relevant deviation in PET (i.e. difference between modelled and measured values). Regression and correlation analyses account for the importance of the deviation of each climatic variable in the deviation of PET values. Deviation of PET appears to be highly conditioned by the deviation of mean radiant temperature values especially during clear sky days. Under overcast conditions deviation of wind speed also becomes a relevant aspect. Consequently, reliable estimation of these variables is required if modelling techniques are to be used in the assessment of thermal comfort in outdoor urban spaces.},

abstract = {Two common forms of traditional land use systems in Mediterranean landscapes are dehesa and hedged fields. Both are agroforestry systems in which domestic stock are pastured: amongst parklike trees in dehesa, and in enclosures surrounded by stone walls and woody vegetation in hedged fields. The latter are now tending to be replaced by dehesa due to labour costs. Here, we investigate the boundary layer microclimate and environmental characteristics of these two land uses in order to evaluate the respective differences in relation to climate modification, soil organic carbon, and soil water content. Fraxinus angustifolia-dominated sites were investigated in the Guadarrama mountains, Spain, in high summer with simultaneous sampling under trees in both dehesa and hedgerows and in adjacent open fields. Whilst temperature profiles were similar in both systems, hedgerows had higher soil water content, lower wind speeds, and higher total soil organic carbon compared to dehesa, and moreover these trends also applied to open fields of the respective systems. We conclude that not only do hedged fields have advantages over dehesa for shelter and production, but that the climatic modifications of hedged field systems potentially modify boundary layer climates on a broader scale than both individual fields and dehesa. Thus, the conservation of hedged field systems provides natural capital and broad environmental gains.},

abstract = {Exotic species invasions create almost ideal conditions for promoting evolutionary diversification: establishment of allopatric populations in new environmental conditions; altered ecological opportunities for native species; and new opportunities for hybridization between previously allopatric taxa. Here, we review recent studies of the evolutionary consequences of species invasions, revealing abundant and widespread examples of exotic species promoting evolutionary diversification via increased genetic differentiation among populations of both exotic and native species and the creation of new hybrid lineages. Our review indicates that, although the well-documented reductions to biodiversity caused by exotic species might outweigh the increases resulting from diversification, a complete understanding of the net effects of exotic species on biodiversity in the long term will require consideration of both.},

@article{Soux2004,
abstract = {Whilst the measurement of radiation emissions from a surface is relatively straightforward, correct interpretation and proper utilization of the information requires that the surface area 'seen' be known accurately. This becomes non-trivial when the target is an urban surface, due to its complex three-dimensional form and the different thermal, radiative and moisture properties of its myriad surface facets. The geometric structure creates shade patterns in combination with the solar beam and obscures portions of the surface from the sensor, depending on where it is pointing and its field-of-view (FOV). A model to calculate these surface-sensor-sun relations (SUM) is described. SUM is tested against field and scale model observations, and theoretical calculations, and found to perform well. It can predict the surface area 'seen' by a sensor of known FOV pointing in any direction when placed at any point in space above a specified urban surface structure. Moreover, SUM can predict the view factors of the roof, wall and ground facets 'seen' and whether they are sunlit or shaded at any location and time of day. SUM can be used to determine the optimal placement and orientation of remote sensors to study urban radiation emissions; if the facet temperatures are known or modelled it can calculate the average temperature of the system, and it can determine the directional variation of temperature (anisotropy) due to any particular surface-sensor-sun geometric combination. The present surface geometry used in SUM is relatively simple, but there is scope to make it increasingly realistic.},

Further clustering of households allows the calculation of elasticities across household types. The findings show that walkability indices are highly correlated with walking trips for most non-work trip purposes, although socio-demographic characteristics also play a key role. Additionally households with more mobility choices are more sensitive to their surroundings than those with less choice. Our findings highlight the fact that a walkability index will not have the same correlation with travel behavior for all individuals or households. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in the early 1960s, the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has demonstrated a capacity to adapt and change in the face of new challenges. The reformed CAP, under AGENDA 2000, encourages more environmentally friendly farming practices. In the context of their rural development plans, Member States are required to link policies on agriculture with protection of the environment and to ensure that farmers meet environmental standards. Additionally, Member States should maintain and restore the quality of both their aquatic and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems according to the Directive 2000/60/EU, 'Establishing a framework for Community Action in the field of Water Policy'. Within this framework, agri-environmental indicators play an important role in planning and implementing CAP guidelines. However, selection and use of the proper indicators remains unresolved, considering that ecosystem processes are complex and interactions in most cases not obvious. This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the environmental state and impacts of current land use and management when implementing agri-environmental measures of CAP. The proposed methodology includes a modified Driving forces-Pressures-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) framework, identification of Zones of Specific Functional Interest (ZSFI), and criteria for selecting agri-environmental indicators, which assess the functional performance of each zone and meet existing legislation. The Mygdonia Watershed (Greece) is an example where through use of both the appropriate Minimum Data Set of agri-environmental indicators at the identified zones and the proposed modified DPSIR, the functioning performance of each ZSFI can be assessed to evaluate the applied agri-environmental measures.},

abstract = {Rational layout of vegetation can significantly alleviate the urban heat-island effect and improve outdoor thermal environment. However, quantitative researches about the impact of different vegetation species on the outdoor thermal environment are still scarce and the actual engineering problem that what's the best choice, grass, shrub or trees cannot be responded. Meanwhile, a three-dimensional model which can accurately predict the effect of green on thermal environment and guide the green design is urgently needed. Thus, a finite volume method with unstructured mesh is used to simulate the impact of vegetation on the outdoor thermal environment for three common vegetation species, namely: trees, shrub and lawn. Special attention is paid on the variation of air temperature at 1.5m, surface temperature, PET, WBGT, wind speed and pressure with these species. The study could be described as follows: A simulation method including the model of three-dimensional vegetation is developed for predicting and evaluating the outdoor thermal environment and its accuracy is confirmed by comparing simulation results and field measured data; For different evaluation standards and areas, the sequence of the improvement of different species on outdoor thermal environment is quite different: For air temperature at 1.5 m and thermal comfort and safety (PET and WBGT), the sequence is trees{\textgreater} lawn{\textgreater} shrubs, but for surface temperature, the sequence is lawn{\textgreater} shrubs{\textgreater} trees; For these areas located in the downstream of planting area, trees and shrub can reduce the wind speed and decrease the pressure of the building. But for these areas located in the downstream of without planting area, they can increase the wind speed and the pressure; Suggestions are provided to guide the arrangement of these species in planning stage to achieve the purpose of optimizing outdoor thermal environment in summer and outdoor wind environment in winter.},

abstract = {The diurnal land surface temperature (LST) variation is a primary characteristic of the effects of urbanization. However, no study to date has focused on changes in diurnal LST variation in urban environments. This paper investigates the effects of urbanization on landscape pattern and diurnal LST variation of Taipei City, using MODIS thermal images and SPOT multispectral remote sensing images over the 1994–2010 period. Supervised land-cover classifications were conducted to investigate decadal land-cover changes within the study area. A remote-sensing-based urbanization index was adopted as a quantitative measure of urbanization-induced changes in landscape patterns. Diurnal LST variations were assessed using MODIS Aqua satellite images. We found that the diurnal LST variation increases with the urbanization index, with the adverse effects of urbanization on the diurnal LST variation being more substantial in the earlier stages of urbanization. Increasing diurnal LST variation due to urbanization implies that urbanization is likely to result in a greater increase in urban heat absorption than in thermal inertia. This research provides insightful supporting evidence that, in mitigating UHI effects, measures that can reduce urban heat absorption such as urban parks, community green spaces, green roofs and cool (or permeable) pavements should be given higher priority.},

In order to explain the process, and to better understand the related influential factors, we conducted an extensive survey of thermally comfortable conditions in open outdoor spaces. The goal of this study was to gain an insight into the subjects' perspectives on weather variables and comfort levels, and determine the factors responsible for the varying human thermal comfort response in summer. These perceptions were then compared to actual ambient conditions. The database consists of surveys rated by 205 students trained from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm outdoors from 21 to 25 August 2009, at Nanjing University of Information Science {\&} Technology (NUIST), Nanjing, China. The multiple regression approach and simple factor analysis of variance were used to investigate the relationships between thermal comfort and meteorological environment, taking into consideration individual mood, gender, level of regular exercise, and previous environmental experiences. It was found that males and females have similar perceptions of maximum temperature; in the most comfortable environment, mood appears to have a significant influence on thermal comfort, but the influence of mood diminishes as the meteorological environment becomes increasingly uncomfortable. In addition, the study confirms the strong relationship between thermal comfort and microclimatic conditions, including solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, maximum temperature, wind speed and relative humidity, ranked by importance. There are also strong effects of illness, clothing and exercise, all of which influence thermal comfort. We also find that their former place of residence influences people's thermal comfort substantially by setting expectations. Finally, some relationships between thermal perception and amount of exercise, thermal experience, mood, clothing, illness and microclimate, etc., are established. Our findings also shed light on how to resist or adapt to outdoor hyperthermic conditions during summer in subtropical monsoon climate areas.},

abstract = {Tropical forests appear to take longer to recover in dry than in humid areas, thus water has been recognized as a key structuring factor in tropical dry forests (TDF). We examine this hypothesis in arid ecosystems of the Macanao Peninsula, Venezuela. Opencast sand mining is one of the primary economic activities in the region, modifying the soil, degrading biodiversity and ecosystem services, and affecting key plant and animal species. We quantiﬁed growth and survival of ﬁve native trees (Tecoma stans, Bulnesia arborea, Piscidia carthagenensis, Prosopis juliﬂora and Cercidium praecox) under eight treatments, combining hydrogel, fertilizer and water. After six months in a nursery, 640 seedlings were planted in 16 ﬁeld plots of 100 m2 each, two for each treatment. Eight months later, the treatment with the greatest impact on plant growth was hydrogel only; also the most cost-effective option. Our results support the water-limitation hypothesis, and show that improving water supply to seedlings greatly increases their growth and survival. Our experimental design is applicable to the restoration of any TDF where human disturbance has caused a large-scale modiﬁcation to the ecosystem, preventing the progression of natural succession.},

@article{Jin2005,
abstract = {One mechanism for climate change is the collected impact of changes in land cover or land use. Such changes are especially significant in urban areas where much of the world's population lives. Satellite observations provide a basis for characterizing the physical modifications that result from urbanization. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra satellite measures surface spectral albedos, thermal emissivities, and radiative temperatures. A better understanding of these measurements should improve our knowledge of the climate impact of urbanization as well as our ability to specify the parameters needed by climate models to compute the impacts of urbanization. For this purpose, it is useful to contrast urban areas with neighboring nonurban surfaces with regard to their radiative surface temperatures, emissivities, and albedos. Among these properties, surface temperatures have been most extensively studied previously in the context of the "urban heat island" (UHI). Nevertheless, except for a few detailed studies, the UHI has mostly been characterized in terms of surface air temperatures. To provide a global analysis, the zonal average of these properties are presented here measured over urban areas versus neighboring nonurban areas. Furthermore, individual cities are examined to illustrate the variations of these variables with land cover under different climate conditions [e.g., in Beijing, New York, and Phoenix (a desert city of the United States)]. Satellite-measured skin temperatures are related to the surface air temperatures but do not necessarily have the same seasonal and diurnal variations, since they are more coupled to surface energy exchange processes and less to the overlying atmospheric column. Consequently, the UHI effects from skin temperature are shown to be pronounced at both daytime and nighttime, rather than at night as previously suggested from surface air temperature measurements. In addition, urban areas are characterized by albedos much lower than those of croplands and deciduous forests in summer but similar to those of forests in winter. Thus, urban surfaces can be distinguished from nonurban surfaces through use of a proposed index formed by multiplying skin temperature by albedo.},

According to the nothing to hide argument, there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers unlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate justification to claim that it remain private. The nothing to hide argument and its variants are quite prevalent, and thus are worth addressing. In this essay, Solove critiques the nothing to hide argument and exposes its faulty underpinnings.},

abstract = {This study provides an overview of projected changes in climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices ({\{}ETCCDI).{\}} The temperature- and precipitation-based indices are computed with a consistent methodology for climate change simulations using different emission scenarios in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 ({\{}CMIP3){\}} and Phase 5 ({\{}CMIP5){\}} multimodel ensembles. We analyze changes in the indices on global and regional scales over the 21st century relative to the reference period 1981–2000. In general, changes in indices based on daily minimum temperatures are found to be more pronounced than in indices based on daily maximum temperatures. Extreme precipitation generally increases faster than total wet-day precipitation. In regions, such as Australia, Central America, South Africa, and the Mediterranean, increases in consecutive dry days coincide with decreases in heavy precipitation days and maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation, which indicates future intensification of dry conditions. Particularly for the precipitation-based indices, there can be a wide disagreement about the sign of change between the models in some regions. Changes in temperature and precipitation indices are most pronounced under {\{}RCP8.5{\}}, with projected changes exceeding those discussed in previous studies based on {\{}SRES{\}} scenarios. The complete set of indices is made available via the {\{}ETCCDI{\}} indices archive to encourage further studies on the various aspects of changes in extremes.},

abstract = {Gobal methane emissions were estimated for 2000–2012 using the CarbonTracker Europe-CH4 (CTE-CH4) data assimilation system. In CTE-CH4, the anthropogenic and biosphere emissions of CH4 are simultaneously constrained by global atmospheric in-situ methane mole fraction observations. We use three configurations developed in Tsuruta et al. (2016) to assess the sensitivity of the CH4 flux estimates to (a) the number of unknown flux scaling factors to be optimized which in turn depends on the choice of underlying land-ecosystem map, and (b) on the parametrization of vertical mixing in the 30 atmospheric transport model TM5. The posterior emission estimates were evaluated by comparing simulations to surface in-situ observation sites, to profile observations made by aircraft, to dry air total column-averaged mole fractions (XCH4) observations from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), and to XCH4 retrievals from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). Our estimated posterior mean global total emissions during 2000–2012 are 516 ± 51 Tg CH4 yr−1, and emission estimates during 2007–2012 are 18 Tg CH4 yr−1 greater than those from 2001–2006, mainly driven by an 35 increase in emissions from the south America temperate region, the Asia temperate region and Asia tropics. The sensitivity of the flux estimates to the underlying ecosystem map was large for the Asia temperate region and Australia, but not significant in the northern latitude regions, i.e. the north American boreal region, the north American temperate region and Europe. Instead, the posterior estimates for the northern latitude regions show larger sensitivity to the choice of convection scheme in TM5. The Gregory et al. (2000) mixing scheme with faster interhemispheric exchange leads to higher estimated CH4 emissions at northern latitudes, and lower emissions in southern latitudes, compared to the estimates using Tiedtke (1989) convection scheme. Our evaluation with non-assimilated observations showed that posterior mole fractions were better matched with the 5 observations when Gregory et al. (2000) convection scheme was used.},

abstract = {A methodology for developing a simple theoretical model for calculating global insolation on a horizontal surface is described in this paper. The input parameters to the model are the latitude of the desired location and the amount of total precipitable water content in the vertical column at that location. Both the parameters are easily measurable with inexpensive instrument such as global positioning system (GPS). The principal idea behind the paper is to have a model that could be used for designing a photovoltaic system quickly and within reasonable accuracy. The model in this paper has been developed using measured data from 12 locations in India covering length and breadth of the country over a period of 9-22 years. The model is validated by calculating theoretical global insolation for five locations, one in north (New Delhi), one in south (Thiruvanandapuram), one in east (Kolkata), one in west (Mumbai) and one in central (Nagpur) part of India and comparing them with the measured insolation values for these five locations. The measured values of all these locations had been considered for developing the model. The model is further validated for a location (Goa) whose measured data is not considered for developing the model, by comparing the calculated and measured values of the insolation. Over the range of latitudes covering most parts of India, the error is within 20{\%} of the measured value. This gives the credibility of the model and the methodology used for developing the model for any region in the world. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A total of 458 urban Japanese and 601 Indonesians participated in a questionnaire. In addition, in a preliminary survey, 39 native English speakers in the UK participated. Our results showed that (1) for Indonesians, the closest thermal descriptor of a feeling of thermal comfort was 'cool' (75{\%}) followed by 'slightly cool' (7{\%}), 'slightly cold' (5{\%}) and 'cold' (5{\%}), while Japanese responses were distributed uniformly among descriptors 'cool', 'slightly cool', 'neither', 'slightly warm', and 'warm'; (2) the closest thermal descriptors of a feeling of discomfort for Indonesians were less affected by individual thermal susceptibility (vulnerability) than those for Japanese; (3) in the cases where 'cool' and 'slightly cold' were imagined in the mind, the descriptors were cognized as a thermal comfortable feeling by 97{\%} and 57{\%} of Indonesians, respectively; (4) the most frequently voted choice endorsing hot weather was 'higher than 32°C' for Indonesians and 'higher than 29°C' for Japanese respondents; for cold weather, 'lower than 15°C' for Japanese and 'lower than 20°C' for Indonesians. In summary, the descriptor 'cool' in Indonesians connotes a thermally comfortable feeling, but the inter-zone between hot and cold weather that was judged in the mind showed a upward shift when compared to that of Japanese. It is suggested that linguistic heat acclimatization exists on a cognitive level for Indonesians and is preserved in the words of thermal descriptors.},

abstract = {Abstract: A review of various strategies for implementing Monte Carlo analysis of radiative media is presented. Comparisons of the performance (defined as the variance of the results multiplied by the CPU time required for solution) are presented for three common methods used in Monte Carlo solution. Methods of treating complex geometries are also explored and compared, and a ray-tracing technique based on finite-element models of the geometry is presented. The finite-element models allow use of commercial codes for describing complex geometries, and also allow efficient coupling of the Monte Carlo radiative model with other finite-element-based thermal models. The utility and performance of the direct simulation Monte Carlo ray-tracing methods in engineering problems involving realistic properties are examined. Strategies are compared for treating anisotropic scattering distributions, nonuniform temperatures and radiative properties, and spectral property variations. The effects of scattering on ray tracing and the necessary modifications to the algorithms are evaluated, and the performance and accuracy of these algorithms are evaluated and recommendations are suggested. The difficulties in handling inhomogeneous properties and spectrally dependent properties are presented, and some possible approaches are proposed and compared. Monte Carlo strategies for solving radiative transfer in participating media are described for use on parallel processors using different common architectures. An example benchmark problem is carried out to demonstrate the degree of speedup that can be obtained. ?? 1998 Academic Press Inc.},

abstract = {In the present work, an experimental urban canyon (scale 1:10) with 4. cm concrete wall thickness and full scale green roof was used to evaluate the impact of green roof inside and outside the buildings. The platform was equally used to validate a coupled heat and mass transfer model for green roof behavior. The albedo of the green roof was measured and implemented in the numerical model. The developed model has been coupled to a building thermal code (TRNSYS). Then, simulations were conducted for the experimental urban canyon studied where a comparison was undertaken between green and conventional roofing. A reduction of the maximum roof surface temperature by 20. ??C was found in summer due to the green roof. Green roof protects the roof membrane from high temperature fluctuations increasing the roof longevity and delay the timing of the peak membrane surface temperature by several hours. Also, the presence of vegetation permits to reduce the outside air temperature of the street canyon by 0.8. ??C. Hence, green roofing is an effective solution to reduce the total energy demand and to improve the urban microclimate in the street canyon for an oceanic temperate climate. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We investigate the question of how many facets are needed to represent the energy balance of an urban area by developing simplified 3-, 2- and 1-facet versions of a 4-facet energy balance model of two-dimensional streets and buildings. The 3-facet model simplifies the 4-facet model by averaging over the canyon orientation, which results in similar net shortwave and longwave balances for both wall facets, but maintains the asymmetry in the heat fluxes within the street canyon. For the 2-facet model, on the assumption that the wall and road temperatures are equal, the road and wall facets can be combined mathematically into a single street-canyon facet with effective values of the heat transfer coefficient, albedo, emissivity and thermodynamic properties, without further approximation. The 1-facet model requires the additional assumption that the roof temperature is also equal to the road and wall temperatures. Idealised simulations show that the geometry and material properties of the walls and road lead to a large heat capacity of the combined street canyon, whereas the roof behaves like a flat surface with low heat capacity. This means that the magnitude of the diurnal temperature variation of the street-canyon facets are broadly similar and much smaller than the diurnal temperature variation of the roof facets. Consequently, the approximation that the street-canyon facets have similar temperatures is sound, and the road and walls can be combined into a single facet. The roof behaves very differently and a separate roof facet is required. Consequently, the 2-facet model performs similarly to the 4-facet model, while the 1-facet model does not. The models are compared with previously published observations collected in Mexico City. Although the 3- and 2-facet models perform better than the 1-facet model, the present models are unable to represent the phase of the sensible heat flux. This result is consistent with previous model comparisons, and we argue that this feature of the data cannot be produced by a single column model. We conclude that a 2-facet model is necessary, and for numerical weather prediction sufficient, to model an urban surface, and that this conclusion is robust and therefore applicable to more general geometries.},

abstract = {To assess the effects of UV radiation and its interaction with water availability on Mediterranean plants, we performed an experiment with seedlings of six Mediterranean species (three mesophytes vs three xerophytes) grown in a glasshouse from May to October under three UV conditions (without UV, with UVA and with UVA+UVB) and two irrigation levels (watered to saturation and low watered). Morphological, physiological and biochemical measures were taken. Exposure to UVA+UVB increased the overall leaf mass per area (LMA) and the leaf carotenoids/chlorophyll a + b ratio of plants in relation to plants grown without UV or with UVA, respectively. In contrast, we did not find a general effect of UV on the leaf content of phenols or UVB-absorbing compounds of the studied species. Regarding plant growth, UV inhibited the above-ground biomass production of well-watered plants of Pistacia lentiscus. Conversely, under low irrigation, UVA tended to abolish the reduction in growth experienced by P. lentiscus plants growing in a UV-free environment, in accordance with UVA-enhanced apparent electron transport rate (ETR) values under drought in this species. UVA also induced an overall increase in root biomass when plants of the studied species were grown under a low water supply. In conclusion, while plant exposition to UVA favored root growth under water shortage, UVB addition only gave rise to photoprotective responses, such as the increase in LMA or in the leaf carotenoids/chlorophyll a + b ratio of plants. Species-specific responses to UV were not related with the xerophytic or mesophytic character of the studied species.},

@article{Roudsari2006,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if precrash vehicle movement is associated with the severity of pedestrian injury. METHODS: We used comprehensive information on pedestrian, vehicle, and injury-related characteristics gathered in the Pedestrian Crash Data Study (PCDS), conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (1994-1998). The odds ratio of severe injuries (injury severity score {\textgreater}/= 15) and crash fatality rate for right- and left-turn collisions at intersection compared with straight vehicle movement were compared using a logistic regression model and taking into consideration the type of vehicle and age of the pedestrians as potential effect modifiers. Later we evaluated the intermediate effect of impact speed on the association by adding it to the logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of 255 collisions eligible for this analysis, the proportion of pedestrian hit during straight movement, right turns, and left turns were 48{\%}, 32{\%}, and 10{\%}, respectively. Sixty percent of the pedestrians in left-turn crashes and 67{\%} of them in right-turn collisions were hit from their left side. For straight movements the pedestrians were equally likely to be struck beginning from the left or right side of the street. After adjustment for pedestrian's age, vehicle movement was a significant predictor of severe injuries (p {\textless} 0.0001) and case fatality (p = 0.003). The association between vehicle precrash movement and severe injuries (p = 0.551) and case fatality (p = 0.912) vanished after adjusting for impact speed. This indicated that the observed association was probably the result of the difference in impact speed and not the precrash movement of the vehicle. CONCLUSION: Pedestrian safety interventions that aim at environmental modifications, such as crosswalk repositioning, might be the most efficient means in reducing right- or left-turn collisions at intersection, while pedestrians' behavioral modifications should be the priority for alleviating the magnitude of the collisions that happen in vehicles' straight movements.},

The negative effects of travel time uncertainty can be reduced by providing travellers with travel time information, which improves their estimate of the expected travel time, thereby reducing scheduling costs. In order to assess the negative effects of uncertainty and the benefits of travel time information, this paper proposes a conceptual model of departure time choice under travel time uncertainty and information. The model is based on expected utility theory, and includes the variation in travel time, the quality of travel time information and travellers' perception of the travel time.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Doing regular physical activity has positive effects on health. Several environmental factors are identified as important correlates of physical activity. However, there seems to be a difference between perceived and objective measures of the environment. This study examines the influence of physical activity, neighbourhood walkability, and socio-demographic characteristics on the correspondence between self-reported and objectively measured walking time to urban destinations of adults in the city of Ghent (Belgium). METHODS: Previously collected survey data was used from 1164 respondents in the city of Ghent who reported walking times to various closest destinations in the neighbourhood of residence. These were compared with corresponding walking times that were objectively measured through geographical information systems. Physical activity was recorded over a 7-day period using accelerometers. Neighbourhood walkability was assessed on the basis of residential density, connectivity, and land-use mix. RESULTS: We observed a relatively poor agreement between objective and perceived walking times. Stronger agreements were noted amongst the most physically active group, while low-level walkers tended to overestimate walking time. Surprisingly, however, people residing in a low-walkable neighbourhood underestimated walking times more frequently relative to those in high-walkable neighbourhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers investigating the influence of environmental attributes on physical activity behavior should thus be cautious when using only self-reported environmental data, since these are a priori influenced by physical activity levels and various socio-demographic factors.},

@article{Bijoor2011,
abstract = {Despite its importance for urban planning, landscape management, and water management, there are very few in situ estimates of urban-forest transpiration. Because urban forests contain an unusual and diverse mix of species from many regions worldwide, we hypothesized that species composition would be a more important driver of spatial variability in urban-forest transpiration than meteorological variables in the Los Angeles (California, USA) region. We used constant-heat sap-flow sensors to monitor urban tree water use for 15 species at six locations throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. For many of these species no previous data on sap flux, water use, or water relations were available in the literature. To scale sap-flux measurements to whole trees we conducted a literature survey of radial trends in sap flux across multiple species and found consistent relationships for angiosperms vs. gymnosperms. We applied this relationship to our measurements and estimated whole-tree and plot-level transpiration at our sites. The results supported very large species differences in transpiration, with estimates ranging from 3.2 6 2.3 kg?tree?1?d?1 in unirrigated Pinus canariensis (Canary Island pine) to 176.9 6 75.2 kg?tree?1?d?1 in Platanus hybrida (London planetree) in the month of August. Other species with high daily transpiration rates included Ficus microcarpa (laurel fig), Gleditsia triacanthos (honeylocust), and Platanus racemosa (California sycamore). Despite irrigation and relatively large tree size, Brachychiton populneas (kurrajong), B. discolor (lacebark), Sequoia sempervirens (redwood), and Eucalyptus grandis (grand Eucalyptus) showed relatively low rates of transpiration, with values , 45 kg?tree?1?d?1. When scaled to the plot level, transpiration rates were as high as 2 mm/d for sites that contained both species with high transpiration rates and high densities of planted trees. Because plot-level transpiration is highly dependent on tree density, we modeled transpiration as a function of both species and density to evaluate a likely range of values in irrigated urban forests. The results show that urban forests in irrigated, semi-arid regions can constitute a significant use of water, but water use can be mitigated by appropriate selection of site, management method, and species.},

abstract = {Biofilters are a technology being implemented to manage stormwater by reducing stormwater runoff volumes, peak flows, and pollutant levels. In light of their increasing popularity, a model for assessing the performance of stormwater biofilters was previously developed by the authors. This model contains a hydrologic and a water quality component. The objective of this study was to test the hydrologic component against data obtained over an 8-month period between 2010 and 2011 from an operating field system, the Monash University carpark biofilter. We found that the model is able to replicate some of the observed peak flows, but is unable to replicate low flows. The model slightly underestimated the system's hydraulic performance, with the modelled total outflow volumes over the 8-month period being 12 to 32{\%} less than the measured volumes. Further work is required to refine the model by accounting for the spatial and temporal variability of hydraulic conductivity, and by incorporating soil-specific field capacity parameters. However, despite these limitations, the model is a useful design tool as it is able to provide a conservative estimate of biofilter volume and rather accurate estimate of peak flow reductions in a quick and easy way.},

abstract = {A generalized approach for estimating season-specific diurnal profiles of anthropogenic heating for cities is presented. Each profile consists of heat released from three components: building sector, transportation sector, and metabolism. In turn, the building sector is divided into heat released from electricity consumption and heat released from heating fuels such as natural gas and fuel oil. Each component is developed separately based on a population density formulation. The profiles are based on commonly available data resources that are mapped onto the diurnal cycle using seasonal profile functions. Representative winter and summer weekday profiles are developed and presented for six large US cities. The diurnal profiles have morning and evening peaks, with summertime maxima up to 60Wm
                        -2. Anthropogenic heating in winter is generally larger, with maxima up to 75Wm
                        -2. While these analyses were carried out at the city-scale the paper discusses how the same data sources could be applied at scales down to the individual census tract (or traffic analysis zone), resulting in high spatial resolution profiles and larger maxima corresponding to higher population densities in the urban core. Based on our analysis of San Francisco we find that the urban core region may have a daytime population density that is 5-10 times that of the city-scale value. Hence, the corresponding anthropogenic heating values in the urban core will be 5-10 times the magnitudes of the city-scale values presented in this paper. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

At these depots, workers must don protective clothing that increases their risk of heat-related injury. Because of the difficulty in making continuous, accurate measurements of wet bulb globe temperature outdoors, the authors have developed a model of the wet bulb globe temperature that relies only on standard meteorological data available at each storage depot for input. The model is composed of separate submodels of the natural wet bulb and globe temperatures that are based on fundamental principles of heat and mass transfer, has no site-dependent parameters, and achieves an accuracy of better than 1 degree C based on comparisons with wet bulb globe temperature measurements at all depots.},

Data from three different satellite sensors – including the Oceansat-2 scatterometer, the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/ Sounder – are combined to obtain composite melt maps, representing the most complete melt conditions detectable across the ice sheet. Satellite observations reveal that melt occurred at or near the surface of the Greenland ice sheet across 98.6{\%} of its entire extent on 12 July 2012, including the usu- ally cold polar areas at high altitudes like Summit in the dry snow facies of the ice sheet. This melt event coincided with an anomalous ridge of warm air that became stagnant over Greenland. As seen in melt occurrences from multiple ice core records at Summit reported in the published literature, such a melt event is rare with the last significant one occurring in 1889 and the next previous one around seven centuries earlier in the Medieval Warm Period. Given its rarity, the 2012 extreme melt across Greenland provides an exceptional opportunity for new studies in broad interdisciplinary geo- physical research.},

Smart growth planning supports the need not only to build additional nonmotorized facilities, but also to improve the planning, prioritization, and funding process. Identifying pedestrian infrastructure needs through the development of an index can resolve inconsistencies and inequities regarding funding sustainable transportation infrastructure. This research investigates how transportation planning agencies can improve the process of prioritizing pedestrian improvement projects through two objectives: (1) the development of the pedestrian corridor improvement index (PCII); and (2) the application of PCII to pathways in Union County, Pennsylvania, as a case study. The PCII integrates pedestrian performance metrics with the analytic hierarchy process to assist in the prioritization of pedestrian pathway improvements. In order to test the appl...},

Following extensive validation of accessible models of human thermoregulation, the advanced multi-node 'Fiala' model was selected to form the basis of UTCI. This model was coupled with an adaptive clothing model which considers clothing habits by the general urban population and behavioral changes in clothing insulation related to actual environmental temperature. UTCI was developed conceptually as an equivalent temperature. Thus, for any combination of air temperature, wind, radiation, and humidity, UTCI is defined as the air temperature in the reference condition which would elicit the same dynamic response of the physiological model. This review analyses the sensitivity of UTCI to humidity and radiation in the heat and to wind in the cold and compares the results with observational studies and internationally standardized assessment procedures. The capabilities, restrictions and potential future extensions of UTCI are discussed.},

@article{Gao2016,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We have implemented an existing aerosol microphysics scheme into a box model framework and extended it to represent gas-particle partitioning and chemical ageing of semi-volatile organic aerosols. We then applied this new research tool to investigate the effects of semi-volatile organic species on the growth, composition and mixing state of aerosol particles in case studies representing several different environments. The volatility-basis set (VBS) framework is implemented into the aerosol microphysical scheme MATRIX (Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state), which resolves mass and number aerosol concentrations and in multiple mixing-state classes. The new scheme, MATRIX-VBS, has the potential to significantly advance the representation of organic aerosols in Earth system models by improving upon the conventional representation as non-volatile particulate organic matter, often with also an assumed fixed size distribution. We present results from idealized cases representing Beijing, Mexico City, a Finnish and a Southeast U.S. forest, and investigate the evolution of mass concentrations and volatility distributions for organic species across the gas and particle phases, as well as assessing their mixing state among aerosol populations. Emitted semi-volatile primary organic aerosols evaporate almost completely in the high volatile range, while they remain in the particle phase in the low volatility range. Their volatility distribution depends on the applied emission factors, oxidation by OH radicals, and temperature. We also compare against parallel simulations with the original scheme, which represented only the particulate and non-volatile component of the organic aerosol, examining how differently the condensed phase organic matter is distributed across the mixing states in the model. The results demonstrate the importance of representing organic aerosol as a semi-volatile aerosol, and explicitly calculating the partitioning of organic species between the gas and particulate phases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Establishing quantitative links between plant hydraulic properties and the response of transpiration to environmental factors such as atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D) is essential for improving our ability to understand plant water relations across a wide range of species and environmental conditions. We studied stomatal responses to D in irrigated trees in the urban landscape of Los Angeles, California. We found a strong linear relationship between the sensitivity of tree-level transpiration estimated from sap flux (m(T); slope of the relationship between tree transpiration and ln D) and transpiration at D=1 kPa (E(Tref)) that was similar to previous surveys of stomatal behavior in natural environments. In addition, m(T) was significantly related to vulnerability to cavitation of branches (P(50)). While m(T) did not appear to differ between ring- and diffuse-porous species, the relationship between m(T) and P(50) was distinct by wood anatomy. Therefore, our study confirms systematic differences in water relations in ring- versus diffuse-porous species, but these differences appear to be more strongly related to the relationship between stomatal sensitivity to D and vulnerability to cavitation rather than to stomatal sensitivity per se.},

abstract = {We present a generic scoring system that compares the impact of alien species among members of large taxonomic groups. This scoring can be used to identify the most harmful alien species so that conservation measures to ameliorate their negative effects can be prioritized. For all alien mammals in Europe, we assessed impact reports as completely as possible. Impact was classified as either environmental or economic. We subdivided each of these categories into five subcategories (environmental: impact through competition, predation, hybridization, transmission of disease, and herbivory; economic: impact on agriculture, livestock, forestry, human health, and infrastructure). We assigned all impact reports to one of these 10 categories. All categories had impact scores that ranged from zero (minimal) to five (maximal possible impact at a location). We summed all impact scores for a species to calculate "potential impact" scores. We obtained "actual impact" scores by multiplying potential impact scores by the percentage of area occupied by the respective species in Europe. Finally, we correlated species' ecological traits with the derived impact scores. Alien mammals from the orders Rodentia, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora caused the highest impact. In particular, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), muskrat (Ondathra zibethicus), and sika deer (Cervus nippon) had the highest overall scores. Species with a high potential environmental impact also had a strong potential economic impact. Potential impact also correlated with the distribution of a species in Europe. Ecological flexibility (measured as number of different habitats a species occupies) was strongly related to impact. The scoring system was robust to uncertainty in knowledge of impact and could be adjusted with weight scores to account for specific value systems of particular stakeholder groups (e.g., agronomists or environmentalists). Finally, the scoring system is easily applicable and adaptable to other taxonomic groups.},

Neighborhood walka- bility was measured using Geographic Information Systems data on dwelling density, intersection density, net retail area, and land-use mix. Participants completed the NEWS-AU and reported weekly minutes of walking for transport and recreation (International Physical Activity Questionnaire [IPAQ]). Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) was used to define the individual- and Census Collection District (CCD)-level measurement model of the NEWS-AU. Seven individual- level and five CCD-level factors were identified. These measurement models were somewhat similar to those of the original Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS). Patterns of associations between the NEWS-AU factors/scales and the walking measures provided some validity evidence for the instrument.},

abstract = {One widely recognized opportunity to reduce global carbon emissions is to make urban neighborhoods more resource efficient. Significant effort has hence gone into developing computer-based design tools to ensure that individual buildings use less energy. While these tools are increasingly used in practice, they currently do not allow design teams to model groups of dozens or hundreds of buildings effectively, which is why a growing number of research teams are working on dedicated urban modeling tools. Many of these teams concentrate on isolated sustainable performance aspects such as operational building energy use or transportation; however, limited progress has been made on integrating multiple performance aspects into one tool and/or on penetrating urban design education and practice. In this paper a new Rhinoceros-based urban modeling design tool called umi is presented which allows users to carry out operational energy, daylighting and walkability evaluations of complete neighborhoods. The underlying simulation engines are EnergyPlus, Radiance/Daysim as well as a series of Grasshopper and Python scripts. Technical details of umi along with a case study of a mixed use development in Boston are documented.},

This study developed a conceptual framework integrating physical and social characteristics of different green-space types in Vienna, Austria and investigated the preferences of 692 on-site visitors. A stated choice model with digitally calibrated images found that visitors' general preferences are similar to their site preferences when seeking stress relief. However, for stress relief, visitor numbers played a more important role in their green-space choices, while litter and trail environment played a larger role in general preferences. The stress-relief preferences of respondents did not differ remarkably subject to their own reported stress level. Recommendations for green-space planning are derived.},

abstract = {Urban areas encounter a common problem called the heat island effect. Public-space plantings and parks have become a crucial countermeasure for decreasing urban temperatures. In this study, field measurements were carried out in a subtropical park in the summer to investigate the effect of plantings on microclimate and the thermal environment of pedestrian areas. It was found that obstructions affected the wind field; although cold air enters parks, an overcrowding of plants resulted in temperature rises in downstream areas. Shading is a key to thermal comfort in both tropical and subtropical regions, and its effect is augmented by ventilation. Trees that are planted without proper planning can decrease wind movement, which in turn has a detrimental effect on thermal comfort, especially downwind. Wind corridors through urban parks can promote both shading and ventilation, improving thermal comfort, and should thus be considered when designing the layout and trimming of plantings. Data from both fixed- and mobile-type measurements were used to validate the feasibility of a computational fluid dynamics simulation model. It was observed that wind speed and shading are the two main variables that influence the human comfort index, based on which a simpler human comfort assessment was proposed to replace the conventional index, standard effective temperature (SET*). The proposed method can be used as a guideline for landscape architects when designing planting locations.},

abstract = {Recognising that modifications to the physical attributes of urban space are able to promote improved thermal outdoor conditions and thus positively influence the use of open spaces, a survey to define optimal thermal comfort ranges for passers-by in pedestrian streets was conducted in Curitiba, Brazil. We applied general additive models to study the impact of temperature, humidity, and wind, as well as long-wave and short-wave radiant heat fluxes as summarised by the recently developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) on the choice of clothing insulation by fitting LOESS smoothers to observations from 944 males and 710 females aged from 13 to 91 years. We further analysed votes of thermal sensation compared to predictions of UTCI. The results showed that females chose less insulating clothing in warm conditions compared to males and that observed values of clothing insulation depended on temperature, but also on season and potentially on solar radiation. The overall pattern of clothing choice was well reflected by UTCI, which also provided for good predictions of thermal sensation votes depending on the meteorological conditions. Analysing subgroups indicated that the goodness-of-fit of the UTCI was independent of gender and age, and with only limited influence of season and body composition as assessed by body mass index. This suggests that UTCI can serve as a suitable planning tool for urban thermal comfort in sub-tropical regions.},

abstract = {Abstract Quantitative information about outdoor thermal comfort, on various temporal and spatial scales, is required to design better cities and mitigate heat problems not only in warm but also in temperate climates. The overall objective of this study is to explore the augmentation of global/regional climate changes by urban features such as geometry in a compact mid-rise high-latitude city (Gothenburg). The magnitude of spatial and temporal variations of intra-urban mean radiant temperatures (Tmrt) is quantified using the SOLWEIG (SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry) model. Hourly time resolution, statistically downscaled meteorological data, based on the ECHAM5-GCM under the A1B emission scenario is used to simulate changes in Tmrt and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) at the 20802099 time horizon. Results show that urban geometry causes large intra-urban differences in Tmrt, on hourly, daytime and yearly time scales. In general, open areas are warmer than adjacent narrow street canyons in summer, but cooler in winter. According to the ECHAM5-based scenario, the daytime Tmrt will increase by 3.2 C by the end of this century. This is 0.4 more than simulated increase in air temperature (2.8 C) and is mainly a result of decreases in summer cloudiness. Occasions of strong/extreme heat stress are expected to triple. This equates to 20100 h a year, depending on geometry. Conversely, the number of hours with strong/extreme cold stress decreases by 400450 h. Furthermore, the number of hours with no thermal stress increases by 40200 h a year. The study confirms the potential for using geometry to mitigate daytime thermal stress. A densely built structure mitigates extreme swings in Tmrt and PET, improving outdoor comfort conditions both in summer and in winter. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of including information on either Tmrt or thermal comfort in climate scenarios to describe the combined effects of changes in multiple climate variables and to more realistically measure the impact on humans.

abstract = {The primary purpose of the study was to address the claim that people are more likely to walk to a transit stop if they live on a " walkable" block. An additional purpose was to evaluate the Irvine Minnesota Inventory (IMI) as an environmental audit tool. The IMI was used to measure walkability features of 19 blocks in a revitalizing neighborhood. We hypothesized that residents who walked to a light rail TRAX stop (n = 22) would live on blocks with higher walkability ratings compared to residents who did not walk to TRAX (nonriders, n = 15), or who walked only after a closer TRAX stop was built (new users, n = 11). A MANCOVA indicated the IMI scales differentiated the blocks; the strongest differences were obtained in subscales that measured the block's diversity, safety from crime and density (marginally significant). Participants' perceptions of their complete walk to the transit stop were consistent with the home block IMI scores, with the continuing riders having more positive views than the other two groups. The results show the ability of the IMI to distinguish among blocks in walkability, and support further use of this audit tool in environmental analyses and active living research. We end with a discussion of conceptual and methodological issues in the use of audit tools and provide recommendations for using these measures for local, immediate interests, as well as for building a broader science of environmental measurement. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Effects of solar position and of the ratio of buoyant to inertial forces on flow properties (wind speed and temperature) within an array of urban-like obstacles are investigated. An aligned array of cubes with a plan area density of 0.25 is studied. First, distributions of sensible heat fluxes on built surfaces for different solar positions are determined by the Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3-D (TUF3D) model, a microscale three-dimensional urban energy balance model. These fluxes provide boundary conditions to a Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model, which simulates flow and temperature over the array. Results are evaluated against experimental measurements. Furthermore, microscale variation of flow and temperature as a function of the ratio of buoyant to inertial forces is analyzed. Finally, spatially-averaged flow properties are determined as a function of this ratio, and inform neighbourhood-scale parameterizations for mesoscale modeling of urban flows. Differences between configurations are larger at the microscale than the neighbourhood (spatially-averaged) scale. Spatially-averaged flow properties are impacted primarily for scenarios with high buoyancy-to-inertial force ratios. In addition, an analysis of stationary vs. unsteady flow simulations is made.},

abstract = {Trees play an important role in urban areas by improving air quality, mitigating urban heat islands, reducing stormwater runoff and providing biodiversity habitat. Accurate and up-to-date estimation of urban tree canopy cover (UTC) is a basic need for the management of green spaces in cities, providing a metric from which variation can be understood, change monitored and areas prioritised. Random point sampling methods, such as i-Tree canopy, provide a cheap and quick estimation of UTC for a large area. Remote sensing methods using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and multi-spectral images produce accurate UTC maps, although greater processing time and technical skills are required. In this paper, random point sampling and remote sensing methods are used to estimate UTC in Williamstown, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. High resolution multi-spectral satellite images fused with LiDAR data with pixel-level accuracy are employed to produce the UTC map. The UTC is also estimated by categorising random points a) automatically using the LiDAR derived UTC map and b) manually using Google Maps and i-Tree canopy software. There was a minimum 1{\%} difference between UTC estimated from the map derived from remotely sensed data and only 1000 random points automatically categorised by that same map, indicating the level of error associated with a random sampling approach. The difference between UTC estimated by remote sensing and manually categorised random point sampling varied in range of 4.5{\%} using a confidence level of 95{\%}. As monitoring of urban forest canopy becomes an increasing priority, the uncertainties associated with different UTC estimates should be considered when tracking change or comparing different areas using different methods.},

The measurements were used to evaluate effects of fetch and measurement height on Bowen ratio estimates of latent and sensible heat fluxes. The measurements indicated that significant boundary-layer adjustment occurred within the first 15 m of fetch. For the conditions encountered, the Bowen ratio and its variability increased with measurement height. However, departure from ideal fetch (measurement within the equilibrium sublayer) had only a small effect on flux estimates. The data suggest that when the Bowen ratio is small, the method can be used successfully at fetch-to-height ratios as low as 20:1, much less than the often-quoted value of 100:1. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Forest carbon exchange contributes significantly to the global carbon balance and is therefore being monitored around the world, most notably using eddy covariance technology. In order to extrapolate from these measurements, we need to understand why carbon balance (or net ecosystem production, NEP) differs among forests. Here, we use a detailed model of forest carbon exchange applied to three coniferous European forests with differing NEP to pinpoint reasons for the differences among these sites. The model was parameterised using extensive ecophysiological data obtained at each site. These data gave evidence of major differences among sites in climate, leaf physiology, respiring biomass, leaf area index, and soil and biomass respiration rates. The model was compared with eddy covariance data and found to satisfactorily simulate carbon exchange by each forest. Simulations were then run which interchanged canopy structure, physiology and meteorology among sites, allowing us to quantify the contribution of each factor to the inter-site differences in gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and NEP. The most important factor was the difference in respiration rates, particularly soil respiration rates, among sites. Climate was also very important, with differences in incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) affecting GPP and differences in temperature affecting both GPP and RE. Effects of leaf area index, respiring biomass and leaf physiology on NEP were secondary, but still substantial. The work provides detailed quantitative evidence of the major factors causing differences in NEP among coniferous forests. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During two investigation periods in transient seasons (14 weekdays in autumn 2009 and 15 weekdays in spring 2010) 967 visitors in two inner city squares of Szeged (Hungary) were asked about their estimation of their thermal environment. Interrelationships of subjective assessments-thermal sensation, perceptions and preferences for individual climate parameters-were analyzed, as well as their connections with the prevailing thermal conditions [air temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, mean radiant temperature and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET)]. Thermal sensation showed strong positive relationships with air temperature and solar radiation perception, while wind velocity and air humidity perception had a negative (and weaker) impact. If a parameter was perceived to be low or weak, then it was usually desired to be higher or stronger. This negative correlation was weakest in the case of humidity. Of the basic meteorological parameters, Hungarians are most sensitive to variations in wind. Above PET = 29°C, people usually prefer lower air temperature and less solar radiation. The temperature values perceived by the interviewees correlated stronger with PET, but their means were more similar to air temperature. It was also found that the mean thermal sensation of Hungarians in transient seasons depends on PET according to a quadratic function (R (2) = 0.912) and, consequently, the thermal comfort ranges of the locals differ from that usually adopted.},

abstract = {Current discourses in urban water management emphasise a diversity of water sources and scales of infrastructure for resilience and adaptability. During the last 2 decades, in particular, various small-scale systems emerged and developed so that the debate has largely moved from centralised versus decentralised water systems toward governing integrated and networked systems of provision and consumption where small-scale technologies are embedded in large-scale centralised infrastructures. However, while centralised systems have established boundaries of ownership and management, decentralised water systems (such as stormwater harvesting technologies for the street, allotment/house scales) do not, therefore the viability for adoption and/or continued use of decentralised water systems is challenged. This paper brings together insights from the literature on public sector governance, co-production and social practices model to develop an analytical framework for co-governing such systems. The framework provides urban water practitioners with guidance when designing co-governance arrangements for decentralised water systems so that these systems continue to exist, and become widely adopted, within the established urban water regime.},

The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40{\%} of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation – but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75{\%} of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

The tool utilizes terrain elevation models as part of the design process to subdivide sites and generate urban form to be explored parametrically. It can then be linked to various performance assessment methods. As a proof of concept, the study uses a walkability calculator for three urban form alternatives, and applies genetic algorithms to optimize generated designs through allocation of land-use. Results show a great diversity that converges to near optimal solutions. A discussion is drawn about the effort and time spent to model such iterations versus it's automation using this work flow, and conclusions show the potentials, limitations and directions for future research work.},

@article{Danielsen2009,
abstract = {The growing demand for biofuels is promoting the expansion of a number of agricultural commodities, including oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). Oil-palm plantations cover over 13 million ha, primarily in Southeast Asia, where they have directly or indirectly replaced tropical rainforest. We explored the impact of the spread of oil-palm plantations on greenhouse gas emission and biodiversity. We assessed changes in carbon stocks with changing land use and compared this with the amount of fossil-fuel carbon emission avoided through its replacement by biofuel carbon. We estimated it would take between 75 and 93 years for the carbon emissions saved through use of biofuel to compensate for the carbon lost through forest conversion, depending on how the forest was cleared. If the original habitat was peatland, carbon balance would take more than 600 years. Conversely, planting oil palms on degraded grassland would lead to a net removal of carbon within 10 years. These estimates have associated uncertainty, but their magnitude and relative proportions seem credible. We carried out a meta-analysis of published faunal studies that compared forest with oil palm. We found that plantations supported species-poor communities containing few forest species. Because no published data on flora were available, we present results from our sampling of plants in oil palm and forest plots in Indonesia. Although the species richness of pteridophytes was higher in plantations, they held few forest species. Trees, lianas, epiphytic orchids, and indigenous palms were wholly absent from oil-palm plantations. The majority of individual plants and animals in oil-palm plantations belonged to a small number of generalist species of low conservation concern. As countries strive to meet obligations to reduce carbon emissions under one international agreement (Kyoto Protocol), they may not only fail to meet their obligations under another (Convention on Biological Diversity) but may actually hasten global climate change. Reducing deforestation is likely to represent a more effective climate-change mitigation strategy than converting forest for biofuel production, and it may help nations meet their international commitments to reduce biodiversity loss.},

abstract = {his paper presents the results of a research project conducted in the UK designed to increase understanding of the factors which influence levels of walking and pedestrian route choice. It describes a number of techniques that were used to assess the pedestrian environment from a pedestrian's perspective. These techniques included a computer based tool developed using stated preference surveys to determine the relative values of a range of factors in the pedestrian environment; an on-street survey that was designed to investigate values and attitudes towards different attributes of the pedestrian environment along a route; and finally an ‘on the move survey' where pedestrian volunteers were interviewed while walking along the route in order to get an actual account of their experiences as they walk. A case study is then used to show the benefits and disadvantages of using these different techniques and compares the results of the three techniques along a pedestrian route in the City of Leeds in the UK. The results of this comparison show that there were a number of pedestrian attributes considered important by pedestrians when walking including pavement cleanliness, safe crossing places, and good connectivity. These aspects were highlighted in different ways through the three techniques. The computer based tool allowed different routes to be compared using the same criteria and provided a we ighting for each of the important pedestrian factors and an overall score for the route. The technique did not pick up on the route specific factors that were affecting pedestrians as they walked. The on-street survey allowed a larger range of pedestrian factor s to be considered using a 5 point scale from very good to very bad, which meant that certain factors which were not included in the tool were highlighted as being par ticular problems along specific routes. The final technique involved interviewing pedestrians as they walked along the route with specific questions asked as they crossed junctions and walked along links. This allowed a much greater exploration of the factors that affect how a pedestrian feels as they interact with the built environment and traffic},

abstract = {A numerical model for the computation of the wind field, air temperature and humidity in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) including the urban canopy was developed for urban climate simulation. The governing equations of the model are derived by applying ensemble and spatial averages to the Navier-Stokes equation, continuity equation for heat and water vapour transfer in the air. With the spatial averaging procedure, effects of buildings and other urban structures in the urban canopy can be accounted for by introducing an effective volume function, defined as the ratio between the volume of air in a computational mesh over the total volume of the mesh. The improved k - $\epsilon$ model accounts for the anisotropy of the turbulence field under density stratification. In the improved k - $\epsilon$ model, the transport of momentum and heat in the vertical direction under density stratification is evaluated based on the assumption of a near-equilibrium shear flow where transport effects on the stresses and heat fluxes are negligible. The heating processes at surfaces of buildings and ground are also modelled. The comparison of the computational results obtained with the present model and existing observational data and numerical models shows that the present model is capable of predicting the structure of turbulence in the urban canopy layer under density stratification. Numerical experiments with the new model show that the flow behaviour of the air in the urban canopy layer is strongly affected by the existence of buildings and density stratification.},

@article{Asner1997,
abstract = {Realistic and efficient photon transport modeling at the landscape level is vital to understanding material and energy exchange processes that occur between the biosphere and atmosphere. Our knowledge of the magnitude and dynamics of chemical fluxes in spatially heterogeneous areas is constrained by an insufficient understanding of photon transport at scales larger than a single homogeneous canopy. To address this problem, we examine factors controlling the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the leaf, canopy, and landscape levels. A description of a landscape PAR simulation model based on canopy radiative transfer theory and geometric-optical modeling is provided from a biophysical scaling perspective. Using this model, some of the scaled factors controlling fractional PAR absorption by plants and plant assemblages are discussed. Landscape characteristics influence PAR absorption beyond that which is exerted at the leaf level, but are not divorced from leaf and canopy characteristics. For instance, the spatial distribution of canopies can have a greater effect on PAR absorption than the leaf area index of those canopies, but at the same time, this sensitivity is integrally dependent on canopy leaf area index. Leaf area index has a greater effect on canopy-level PAR absorption than either leaf orientation or leaf optical properties. While some of these relationships can be elucidated through field studies, a comprehensive analysis requires a model that accurately accounts for each interaction based on physical scattering principles.},

abstract = {Highlights  Spatial temperature variations are compared with transpiration in a mid-sized city  Urban tree transpiration significantly enhances microclimate cooling  Nocturnal transpiration induced strong cooling due to limited air mixing at night  Transpiration cooling effect strongest in an enclosed courtyard environment Abstract Global warming is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of heat waves. As the urban geometry and material amplifies warming, city dwellers will face an intensification of heat-induced health problems and mortality. Although increased vegetation cover is frequently used in urban planning to mitigate excessive heat, temporal variations, as well as the influence of synoptic weather conditions and surrounding urban geometry on the vegetation cooling effect, are still unclear. In this study, we monitored the transpiration-induced cooling from trees over two summers in five urban settings characterized by varying levels of greenness and urban geometry in the city of Mainz (Germany). Differences in air temperature and humidity patterns were compared with estimates of tree transpiration derived from high-resolution stem size and sap flow measurements. Results from the five urban sites indicate significant cooling due to transpiration, but with large variability depending on time of day and weather conditions. The cooling effect is strongest during periods of high transpiration demand, and in the stable nocturnal boundary layer when air mixing is limited. The strongest transpiration cooling was found in an enclosed courtyard structure. These findings reveal that a few trees can substantially mitigate urban excess heat, but that the urban geometry, time of the day, and prevailing weather conditions considerably modulate this effect.},

In the present work, leaching of aluminum from aluminum foil in different food solutions was studied. Minced meat was used to prepare six different food solutions using tomato juice, citric acid, apple vinegar, salt, and spices. Three techniques for analysis were used, weight loss (W L) measurements, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM), and Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results clearly indicate that the use of aluminum foil for cooking contributes significantly to the daily intake of aluminum through the cooked foods. The amount of leaching was found to be high in acidic solutions, and even higher with the addition of spices. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the obtained values considered to be unacceptable. Finally, excessive consumption of aluminum from leaching aluminum foil has an extreme health risk effects. Aluminum foil may be used for packing but not for cooking.},

abstract = {AbstractVegetation-covered urban brownfields provide a number of ecosystem services to help tackle current urban challenges, such as preventing a loss of biodiversity, adapting to climate change, and fostering recreational and healthy urban environments. However, the potential benefits for urban areas can only be realized if such brownfields are accepted as vital elements of the urban green infrastructure. The paper addresses the potentials of different types of green urban brownfields to provide particular ecosystem services with an outstanding relevance for the urban environment and the life of local residents, and looks at how these services can be best exploited in urban areas. Based on literature reviews, climate modeling, and a survey, research findings are presented on habitat services, microclimatic regulation services, and recreational services for various types of green urban brownfields. Differences in the quantity and quality of these services can be stated according to the specific and varying vegetation inventory and structural parameters of green urban brownfields. Scenario modeling of the preservation and development or transformation of brownfields into green spaces are used to illustrate the potentials and trade-offs of land-use changes in urban environments. Additionally, the provision of ecosystem services is influenced by the different options of green spaces for reusing brownfields. The paper closes with a discussion of some approaches to implementing these findings in urban realities.},

abstract = {Limited attention has been paid to the value of the aesthetic dimension of the urban environment in altering the character of commuting by bicycle. The positive impact of aesthetics on cycling is primarily related to emotional reactions of an individual. For cyclists, aesthetic experience is a multisensory phenomenon influenced by various motivational factors. The purpose of this paper is to lay out a conceptual framework for studies of the aesthetic experience of commuting bicyclists. Three theoretical approaches were considered for interpretation of information: (1) phenomenology of sensory perception and experience; (2) urban design theory; and (3) environmental aesthetics. Together the three theoretical fields complement each other and explain different viewpoints on this complex subject. Relating earlier studies on bicycling to these theories may elucidate the ways in which bicycling affects how the senses work and how perception of the environment can be interpreted in terms of aesthetic meaning. In particular, speed affects this perception. The importance of aesthetic features has a strong relation to expectations and attitude towards the trip. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Individual contributions to the residual can be quantified through constrained multiple linear regression which identifies the site specific processes that are responsible for the lack of energy budget closure. This residual decomposition approach is applied to energy balance data from the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environ-mental Science Test (SLTEST) site at the Dugway Proving Grounds in the Utah Salt Flats. In this case, energy storage in the soil and underestimation of the soil heat flux accounted for 89{\%} of the residual variance. Underestimation of the sensible and latent heat fluxes had no apparent contribution to the residual, and the contribution of advection to the residual was not statistically significant.},

abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) countermeasures are of growing interest for cities. Field studies of their micro-climatic effects are scarce, yet are essential to properly evaluate their effectiveness and that of anti-UHI policies. The standard approach to determining their micro-climatic effects is to study the difference in measurements made at case and control stations. However, measurements conducted during a pavement-watering experiment in Paris, France reveal that this method mistakes preexisting differences for pavement-watering effects. An alternative approach based on a two-sample t-test was therefore developed and tested with the pavement-watering field trial as a case study. The proposed method proved able to determine the effects of pavement-watering, without misinterpreting preexisting differences. In the process of the case study, watering was found to reduce maximum daily heat stress, while having smaller statistically significant UHI-reducing effects. The greatest effects were reached during the day for all parameters with maximum reductions of 0.79 °C, 1.76 °C and 1.03 °C for air, mean radiant and UTCI-equivalent temperatures and a 4.1{\%} increase in relative humidity, while UHI-mitigation reached up to -0.22 °C. The methodology developed is not specific to pavement-watering and recommendations for its improvement and its application to the field-evaluation of other UHI countermeasures are made.},

abstract = {A simple hardware scale model is used to simulate nocturnal cooling rates for rural and urban environments under calm and cloudless conditions. Comparison with field observations gathered under similar conditions shows the model capable of reproducing many of the features of the temporal development of urban heat islands and the long-wave radiative exchange in urban canyons. The model is used to investigate the roles played by rural/urban differences in geometry and thermal admittance. The results of the experiments show that canyon geometry in the central portion of a city (as measured by the sky view factor) is a relevant variable in producing nocturnal urban heat islands due to its role in regulating long-wave radiative heat loss. It is also demonstrated that this measure is central to the relationship between city size and heat island intensity. The importance of canyon geometry as a feature of urban design is discussed. Thermal admittance differences can also produce realistic heat island features but their magnitude requires quantification in the field.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that daytime patterns of ecosystem carbon assimilation are mostly driven by direct physiological responses to exogenous environmental cues. Under limited environmental variability, little variation in carbon assimilation should thus be expected unless endogenous plant controls on carbon assimilation, which regulate photosynthesis in time, are active. We evaluated this assumption with eddy flux data, and we selected periods when net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was decoupled from environmental variability in seven sites from highly contrasting biomes across a 74° latitudinal gradient over a total of 36 site-years. Under relatively constant conditions of light, temperature, and other environmental factors, significant diurnal NEE oscillations were observed at six sites, where daily NEE variation was between 20{\%} and 90{\%} of that under variable environmental conditions. These results are consistent with fluctuations driven by the circadian clock and other endogenous processes. Our results open a promising avenue of research for a more complete understanding of ecosystem fluxes that integrates from cellular to ecosystem processes.},

We test an implementation of an optimal stomatal conductance model within the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model (LSM). In common with many LSMs, CABLE does not differentiate between {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} model parameters in relation to plant functional type (PFT), but instead only in relation to photosynthetic pathway. We constrained the key model parameter "{\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}", which represents plant water use strategy, by PFT, based on a global synthesis of stomatal behaviour. As proof of concept, we also demonstrate that the {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} parameter can be estimated using two long-term average (1960–1990) bioclimatic variables: (i) temperature and (ii) an indirect estimate of annual plant water availability. The new stomatal model, in conjunction with PFT parameterisations, resulted in a large reduction in annual fluxes of transpiration ({\~{}} 30{\%} compared to the standard CABLE simulations) across evergreen needleleaf, tundra and C4 grass regions. Differences in other regions of the globe were typically small. Model performance against upscaled data products was not degraded, but did not noticeably reduce existing model–data biases. We identified assumptions relating to the coupling of the vegetation to the atmosphere and the parameterisation of the minimum stomatal conductance as areas requiring further investigation in both CABLE and potentially other LSMs. We conclude that optimisation theory can yield a simple and tractable approach to predicting stomatal conductance in LSMs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {There is growing scientific recognition that contact with nature in general, and contact with urban green more specific, have the potential to positively contribute to human health. For the purpose of developing healthy urban neighbourhoods, this raises the question how to take scientific evidence about these health benefits into account. Accessibility metrics that are well substantiated by empirical evidence are needed. This paper reviews the quantitative and qualitative aspects relevant for accessibility metrics and empirical studies addressing these aspects in relation to health. Studies comparing different types of green space indicators suggest that cumulative opportunities indicators are more consistently positively related to health than residential proximity ones. In contrast to residential proximity indicators, cumulative opportunities indicators take all the green space within a certain distance into account. Comparing results across studies proved to be hard. Green space accessibility was measured in a variety of ways and the green space indicator that was chosen was often not problematized. We feel that it is time for a more function-oriented approach. How precisely does contact with nature impact health and what type and qualities are relevant in this regard? We think this will lead to a new generation of more evidence-based accessibility metrics that will help to advance the field.},

abstract = {Trees matter for 21st century neighbourhoods, towns and cities. While over 80{\%} of the UK's population live in urban settings, trees in and around built- up areas – which many call the “urban forest” – have become a key component of the infrastructure that makes places work, look and feel better. Trees are part of the solution to some of the key challenges of our age, from climate change to declining health and well-being. Trees work to restore the environmental and social balance in our neighbourhoods and town centres, contributing to the conditions for economic success. What is more, they can often do so in more cost-effective ways than some traditional forms of infrastructure. Consider for example stormwater management, urban cooling, air quality improvement and the visual amenity of seasonal colourful displays: no single man-made asset will match what a mature tree can deliver. The idea of urban forestry might seem like an oxymoron. Yet the term is internationally used to emphasise how important it is for urban trees to be managed as a whole to bring maximum social, economic and environmental benefits to the local community. The research findings and tools now available for assessing the value of tree benefits make a strong case for this approach. In Torbay for example, the contribution local trees make to air pollution removal and carbon sequestration alone was estimated to be worth {\pounds}6.4m a year. It is not surprising in this context to see urban trees increasingly capturing attention in political decision-making. In 2010 the UK government launched the Big Tree Plant as the national tree planting campaign, alongside which the Mayor of London spearheaded the RE:LEAF initiative aimed at increasing London's tree cover. Further afield, the mayors of the three largest cities in the US – Los Angeles, New York and Chicago – have initiated ambitious urban forest programmes to plant and provide for the long-term stewardship of one million trees over the next few years This guide sets out 12 principles 21st century towns and cities need a 21st century approach to trees – one that keeps pace with and responds to the challenges of our times. Trees in the Townscape offers a comprehensive set of 12 action-oriented principles which can be adapted to the unique context of your own town or city to provide a roadmap for trees in a 21st century context. Each principle is fully supported by explanations of delivery mechanisms, examples of the principle in practice and links to further references. Trees in the Townscape focuses on individual trees in the urban forest, whether highway trees, trees in public open spaces and housing land or private trees. It does not cover urban woodland management. Who should use the 12 principles? The 12 principles in Trees in the Townscape are for everyone involved in making or influencing decisions that shape the spaces and places in which we live. It will be particularly relevant to local elected members, policy makers and community groups together with large land estate owners, such as registered social landlords. It will also be useful to those professionals who bring their technical expertise to facilitate delivery, such as engineers, architects, landscape architects or urban designers. How were the 12 principles developed? This guide was developed by the Trees and Design Action Group (TDAG) based on over 40 interviews and wide consultation with key knowledge holders in the built environment sector including civil engineers, insurers, developers, designers, planners, tree officers, sustainability specialists, arboriculturists, tree nursery managers, ecologists, academics, and not-for-profit organisations specialising in community engagement and trees. More details about TDAG together with a full list of contributors can be found at the end of this document},

abstract = {AbstractOutdoor thermal comfort in urban spaces is an important indicator of the quality of life in an urban environment. This paper attempts to investigate the effect of street design on outdoor thermal comfort in an urban street in the central business district in Singapore, focusing on the design variables of street orientation, height-to-width ratio (H/W), and vegetation. A comprehensive field measurement with multiple points is presented and used to validate a widely used computer software holistic microclimate modeling system. The significance of the research is that real field data from multiple measurement points on microclimate parameters are produced and the effect of street design parameters on outdoor thermal comfort is quantified. It is found in the paper that the NW-SE oriented street is more stressful than the NE-SW street in the afternoon in terms of thermal comfort in Singapore, and that a H/W of 3 can be considered a threshold with respect to outdoor thermal comfort. The paper concludes that the results presented can provide guidance for urban planners and designers to achieve optimized outdoor human thermal comfort.},

Three indices that separately focus on maximum temperature (TX90pct), minimum temperature (TN90pct) and average temperature (EHF) were studied with respect to five characteristics of event intensity, frequency and duration. Despite which index is employed, increases in heatwave/warm spell intensity, frequency and duration are found. Furthermore, TX90pct and TN90pct trends are larger and exhibit more significance for warm spells, implying that non-summer events are driving annual trends over some regions. Larger increases in TN90pct aspects relative to EHF and TX90pct are also observed. While qualitative information on event trends is similar across the indices, quantitative values vary. This result highlights the importance of employing the most appropriate index when assessing the impact of sustained extreme temperature events.},

At 2012, 66{\%} of Australians lived in a capital city. By 2061 this proportion is projected to increase to 74{\%}. {\%}The ageing of Australia's population is expected to continue over the period. This is the result of sustained below replacement levels of fertility combined with increasing life expectancy at birth. The median age of Australia's population (37.3 years at 30 June 2012) is projected to increase to between 38.6 years and 40.5 years in 2031 (Series A and C respectively) and to between 41.0 years and 44.5 years in 2061 (Series A and C). In 2012 people aged 65 years and over made up 14{\%} of Australia's population. This is projected to increase to 22{\%} in 2061 and to 25{\%} in 2101. The proportion of people aged less than 15 years is projected to decrease from 19{\%} in 2012 to 17{\%} in 2061, and 16{\%} in 2101. {\%}There were 420,300 people aged 85 years and over in Australia in 2012, making up 2{\%} of the population. This group is projected to grow rapidly throughout the projection period, to 5{\%} by 2061 and to 6{\%} by 2101.},

abstract = {There has been an ongoing debate in Australia and internationally regarding the effectiveness of bicycle helmets in preventing head injury. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of bicycle helmets in preventing head injury amongst cyclists in crashes involving motor vehicles, and to assess the impact of 'risky cycling behaviour' among helmeted and unhelmeted cyclists. This analysis involved a retrospective, case-control study using linked police-reported road crash, hospital admission and mortality data in New South Wales (NSW), Australia during 2001-2009. The study population was cyclist casualties who were involved in a collision with a motor vehicle. Cases were those that sustained a head injury and were admitted to hospital. Controls were those admitted to hospital who did not sustain a head injury, or those not admitted to hospital. Standard multiple variable logistic regression modelling was conducted, with multinomial outcomes of injury severity. There were 6745 cyclist collisions with motor vehicles where helmet use was known. Helmet use was associated with reduced risk of head injury in bicycle collisions with motor vehicles of up to 74{\%}, and the more severe the injury considered, the greater the reduction. This was also found to be true for particular head injuries such as skull fractures, intracranial injury and open head wounds. Around one half of children and adolescents less than 19 years were not wearing a helmet, an issue that needs to be addressed in light of the demonstrated effectiveness of helmets. Non-helmeted cyclists were more likely to display risky riding behaviour, however, were less likely to cycle in risky areas; the net result of which was that they were more likely to be involved in more severe crashes.},

abstract = {A pedestrian trip is a spatiotemporal process going through different states and related to different decisions made at certain times and locations on the urban network. The analysis of pedestrian trips in terms of crossing patterns is a complex task, which is often further limited by a lack of appropriate and detailed data. The objective of this research is the development and testing of appropriate indicators of pedestrian crossing behavior along urban trips, and a methodology for collecting and processing the data required for the analysis of this behavior. First, a comprehensive set of indicators for the assessment of pedestrian behavior in urban areas is proposed (i.e. average trip length, number, type and location of cross- ings). Then, a GIS tool is developed for the storage and integration of information on pedestrian trips, and the crossings made during the trips, with other geographical information (e.g. road network function and geometry, trafﬁc control and pedestrian facilities). The proposed approach is then tested at network level on a sample of pedestrian trips collected by a ﬁeld survey. The results suggest speciﬁc patterns of pedestrian crossing behavior, such as the tendency to cross at the beginning of the trip and the tendency to cross at mid-block locations when signalized junctions are not available. The results are further discussed in terms of urban planning and management implications. It is concluded that the proposed approach is very efﬁ- cient for the analysis of pedestrian crossing behavior in urban areas.},

abstract = {Research in transportation, urban design, and planning has examined associations between physical environment variables and individuals' walking and cycling for transport. Constructs, methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical activity and health researchers to improve understanding of environmental influences on physical activity. In this review, neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting that residents from communities with higher density, greater connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density, poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport. Implications of the transportation literature for physical activity and related research are outlined. Future research directions are detailed for physical activity research to further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical environment factors on physical activity and the potential interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning literatures provide a valuable starting point for multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to physical activity levels in the population.},

abstract = {Shading coefficients are used to predict the seasonal and diurnal benefit of architectural shading devices. It is more difficult to model the impact of tree shade on building thermal performance, and data is rare and varies greatly with species and season. We established a range of tree shade amounts and shade qualities from which to develop simple, robust models that predict external wall surface temperatures. We measured percentage shade cover, solar irradiance and external surface temperature on north and west sun-bearing walls of three identical buildings in spring and summer 2010/11. One building was shaded by tall Angophora trees, another by smaller Fraxinus trees and one was unshaded.Tree shade reduced wall surface temperatures by up to 9??C and external air temperatures by up to 1??C. The smaller trees did little to reduce external wall surface temperatures, and moving the tall trees further away from the building wall eliminated their cooling benefits. Wall surface temperatures were best predicted by shade cover and solar irradiance, and was most poorly predicted by shading coefficients, that varied greatly through the day and the season, as tree height and leaf area index increased.Trees can reduce external solar irradiance loads when they are close enough and tall enough to shade the majority of the wall. To simulate the thermal performance benefits that trees provide, it is necessary to account for seasonal, growth and phenological changes in tree shade amount and quality. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A new homogenized daily maximum and minimum temperature data set, the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network – Surface Air Temperature data set, has been developed for Australia. This data set contains data from 112 locations across Australia, and extends from 1910 to the present, with 60 locations having data for the full post-1910 period. These data have been comprehensively analysed for inhomogeneities and data errors ensuring a set of station temperature data which are suitable for the analysis of climate variability and trends. For the purposes of merging station series and correcting inhomogeneities, the data set has been developed using a technique, the percentile-matching (PM) algorithm, which applies differing adjustments to daily data depending on their position in the frequency distribution. This method is intended to produce data sets that are homogeneous for higher-order statistical properties, such as variance and the frequency of extremes, as well as for mean values. The PM algorithm is evaluated and found to have clear advantages over adjustments based on monthly means, particularly in the homogenization of temperature extremes.},

abstract = {Abstract Variations in urban surface characteristics are known to alter the local climate through modification of land surface processes that influence the surface energy balance and boundary layer and lead to distinct urban climates. In Melbourne, Australia, urban densities are planned to increase under a new strategic urban plan. Using the eddy covariance technique, this study aimed to determine the impact of increasing housing density on the surface energy balance and to investigate the relationship to Melbourne's local climate. Across four sites of increasing housing density and varying land surface characteristics (three urban and one rural), it was found that the partitioning of available energy was similar at all three urban sites. Bowen ratios were consistently greater than 1 throughout the year at the urban sites (often as high as 5) and were higher than the rural site (less than 1) because of reduced evapotranspiration. The greatest difference among sites was seen in urban heat storage, which wa...},

@article{Castan2013,
abstract = {Cities are key sites where climate change is being addressed. Previous research has largely overlooked the multiplicity of climate change responses emerging outside formal contexts of decision-making and led by actors other than municipal governments. Moreover, existing research has largely focused on case studies of climate change mitigation in developed economies. The objective of this paper is to uncover the heterogeneous mix of actors, settings, governance arrangements and technologies involved in the governance of climate change in cities in different parts of the world. The paper focuses on urban climate change governance as a process of experimentation. Climate change experiments are presented here as interventions to try out new ideas and methods in the context of future uncertainties. They serve to understand how interventions work in practice, in new contexts where they are thought of as innovative. To study experimentation, the paper presents evidence from the analysis of a database of 627 urban climate change experiments in a sample of 100 global cities. The analysis suggests that, since 2005, experimentation is a feature of urban responses to climate change across different world regions and multiple sectors. Although experimentation does not appear to be related to particular kinds of urban economic and social conditions, some of its core features are visible. For example, experimentation tends to focus on energy. Also, both social and technical forms of experimentation are visible, but technical experimentation is more common in urban infrastructure systems. While municipal governments have a critical role in climate change experimentation, they often act alongside other actors and in a variety of forms of partnership. These findings point at experimentation as a key tool to open up new political spaces for governing climate change in the city. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Bern2013,
abstract = {Intersections of major six-lane arterial roadways and minor four-lane arterial roadways are becoming increasingly common across the United States, in part due to the proliferation of hierarchical street design. Such intersections typically have dedicated turn lanes, resulting in large expanses of pavement that make accommodating pedestrians a difficult proposition. Using microsimulation to create over 1,200 scenarios, this research presents the level of service impact of trying to accommodate pedestrian crossings for 117 combinations of vehicle volumes, with the results suggesting that accommodating even modest levels of pedestrian activity will drastically reduce vehicular capacity. The same procedure was repeated for typical mitigation strategies such as slip lanes/pork-chop islands and two-stage pedestrian crossings with minimal improvement. Intersection performance is then compared to a lane-equivalent gridded street network of smaller intersections with the results suggesting that a finer-grained street network is far superior both in terms of accommodating pedestrians as well as overall vehicular capacity.},

abstract = {In Ulaanbaatar, lifestyles differ between urbanized people (group A) and ger (tent)-living people (group B). Group A earn high annual incomes and live in houses or apartments. Group B (who had moved to Ulaanbaatar from nomadic areas) earn low incomes and live in narrow gers. In 2002, we investigated daily food intake, health status, and electrocardiogram (ECG) in these groups. In total, 256 subjects (group A, 142; group B, 114) were enrolled. Group A ate meat, vegetables, and fruits high enough by a Western style. Group B consumed meat but ate only small amounts of vegetables and fruits. They took a lot of fat, however, the serum lipid levels of them were not so high. The fat source as energy was plant oil for cooking rather than meat. Several abnormal ECG findings including left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were found in 32 (22.5{\%}) of group A and 50 (43.9{\%}) of group B (P {\textless} 0.001). LVH was also found more in group B than in group A. LVH in group A males was accompanied by high body weight (BW), hypertension, and high LDL-cholesterol, whereas LVH in group B males seemed to be related to an unbalanced diet, high salt intake, smoking, and some low socio-economic problems. In order to promote health condition, such risk factors should securely be eliminated from the lifestyles.},

abstract = {We propose a simple method to provide a rapid and robust estimate of the short-term impacts of heat waves on mortality, to be used for communication within a heat warning system. The excess mortality during a heat wave is defined as the difference between the observed mortality over the period and the observed mortality over the same period during the N preceding years. This method was tested on 19 French cities between 1973 and 2007. In six cities, we compared the excess mortality to that obtained using a modelling of the temperature-mortality relationship. There was a good agreement between the excess mortalities estimated by the simple indicator and by the models. Major differences were observed during the most extreme heat waves, in 1983 and 2003, and after the implementation of the heat prevention plan in 2006. Excluding these events, the mean difference between the estimates obtained by the two methods was of 13 deaths [1:45]. A comparison of mortality with the previous years provides a simple estimate of the mortality impact of heat waves. It can be used to provide early and reliable information to stakeholders of the heat prevention plan, and to select heat waves that should be further investigated.},

abstract = {Biological invasions dramatically affect the distribution, abundance and reproduction of many native species. Because of these ecological effects, exotic species can also influence the evolution of natives exposed to novel interactions with invaders. Evolutionary changes in natives in response to selection from exotics are usually overlooked, yet common responses include altered anti-predator defenses, changes in the spectrum of resources and habitats used, and other adaptations that allow native populations to persist in invaded areas. Whether a native population is capable of responding evolutionarily to selection from invaders will depend on the demographic impact of the invader, the genetic architecture and genetic variability of the native population and potentially the history of previous invasions. In some cases, natives will fail to evolve or otherwise adapt, and local or global extinction will result. In other cases, adaptive change in natives may diminish impacts of invaders and potentially promote coexistence between invaders and natives. Here, we review the evidence for evolutionary responses of native species to novel community members. We also discuss how the effects of introduced species may differ from those caused by natural range expansions of native species. Notably, introduced species may come from remote biotas with no previous evolutionary history with the native community. In addition, the rate of addition of introduced species into communities is much greater than all but the most extreme cases of historical biotic exchange. Understanding the evolutionary component of exotic/native species interactions is critical to recognizing the long-term impacts of biological invasions, and to understanding the role of evolutionary processes in the assembly and dynamics of natural communities.},

An aging population, a younger generation who prefer walkable places, economic shifts, and the environmental impacts of suburban development are all contributing factors. Suburban retrofitting is occurring or imminent in many suburbs to stave off obsolescence. Although several models exist for the sustainable development of greenfields or large swaths of land, limited models exist for the retrofitting of existing suburban housing stock. To avoid poorly-designed retrofit schemes, this research proposes retrofit design principles aimed at dividing large suburban homes into multiple housing units. A set of design guidelines and practical examples of how large suburban homes can be divided are presented for use by homeowners (or their contractors) to begin the division of a single-family home. The main goal is to equip homeowners and their contractors with the knowledge to divide homes into independent, well-des...},

abstract = {This paper provides a first overview of the performance of state-of-the-art global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in simulating climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), and compares it to that in the previous model generation (CMIP3). For the first time, the indices based on daily temperature and precipitation are calculated with a consistent methodology across multimodel simulations and four reanalysis data sets (ERA40, ERA-Interim, NCEP/NCAR, and NCEP-DOE) and are made available at the ETCCDI indices archive website. Our analyses show that the CMIP5 models are generally able to simulate climate extremes and their trend patterns as represented by the indices in comparison to a gridded observational indices data set (HadEX2). The spread amongst CMIP5 models for several temperature indices is reduced compared to CMIP3 models, despite the larger number of models participating in CMIP5. Some improvements in the CMIP5 ensemble relative to CMIP3 are also found in the representation of the magnitude of precipitation indices. We find substantial discrepancies between the reanalyses, indicating considerable uncertainties regarding their simulation of extremes. The overall performance of individual models is summarized by a “portrait” diagram based on root-mean-square errors of model climatologies for each index and model relative to four reanalyses. This metric analysis shows that the median model climatology outperforms individual models for all indices, but the uncertainties related to the underlying reference data sets are reflected in the individual model performance metrics.},

abstract = {Experts predict that new automobiles will be capable of driving themselves under limited conditions within 5-10 years, and under most conditions within 10-20 years. Automation may affect road vehicle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a host of ways, positive and negative, by causing changes in travel demand, vehicle design, vehicle operating profiles, and choices of fuels. In this paper, we identify specific mechanisms through which automation may affect travel and energy demand and resulting GHG emissions and bring them together using a coherent energy decomposition framework. We review the literature for estimates of the energy impacts of each mechanism and, where the literature is lacking, develop our own estimates using engineering and economic analysis. We consider how widely applicable each mechanism is, and quantify the potential impact of each mechanism on a common basis: the percentage change it is expected to cause in total GHG emissions from light-duty or heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. Our primary focus is travel related energy consumption and emissions, since potential lifecycle impacts are generally smaller in magnitude. We explore the net effects of automation on emissions through several illustrative scenarios, finding that automation might plausibly reduce road transport GHG emissions and energy use by nearly half - or nearly double them - depending on which effects come to dominate. We also find that many potential energy-reduction benefits may be realized through partial automation, while the major energy/emission downside risks appear more likely at full automation. We close by presenting some implications for policymakers and identifying priority areas for further research.},

abstract = {The balanced relationship between nature and urbanity in cities concerning ecology, sustainability, climate, and well-being, is an omnipresent aspect of modern urban planning. Accordingly, the perceived value of trees in urban squares is a crucial, albeit hard to quantify, determinant of successful plaza design. Against this background, we investigate the extent to which the sheer existence of trees affects the perception and assessment of public urban squares. In order to measure the subconscious effects of trees on place perception, a two-group online survey was carried out that simulated different greening scenarios. The empirical results indicated positive effects of trees on the perceived esthetics and characteristics of urban squares, such as city image, worth to stay there, cleanness, and shopping atmosphere. We show that the assumed price level in adjacent restaurants as well as the willingness to visit, in terms of the willingness to stay in an urban square (i.e., the desired duration of visit) and the willingness to revisit it (i.e., the desired frequency of visit), are positively influenced by the presence of trees. Our results provide direct implications for urban planners and city managers. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Objective: Increasing levels of active transport provides benefits in relation to chronic disease and emissions reduction, but it may be associated with an increased risk of road trauma. The safety in numbers (SiN) effect is often regarded as a solution to this issue, however, the mechanisms underlying its influence are largely unknown. We aimed to; i) replicate the SiN effect within a simple, simulated environment, and; ii) vary bicycle density within the environment to better understand the circumstances under which SiN applies. Methods: Using an agent-based modelling approach, we constructed a virtual transport system that increased the number of bicycles from 9{\%} to 35{\%} of total vehicles over a period of 1000 time units while holding the number of cars in the system constant. We then repeated this experiment under conditions of progressively decreasing bicycle density. Results: We demonstrated that the SiN effect can be reproduced in a virtual environment, closely approximating the exponential relationships between cycling numbers and the relative risk of collision as shown in observational studies. The association, however, was highly contingent upon bicycle density. The relative risk of collisions between cars and bicycles with increasing bicycle numbers showed an association that is progressively linear at decreasing levels of density. Conclusions: Agent-based modeling may provide a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms underpinning the relationships previously observed between volume and risk under the assumptions of SiN. The SiN effect may apply only under circumstances in which bicycle density also increases over time. Additional mechanisms underpinning the SiN effect, independent of behavioural adjustment by drivers, are explored.},

@article{Snir2016,
abstract = {The level of thermal stress experienced by pedestrians in an urban environment is affected by their exchange of energy with their surroundings, and the properties of ground-cover vegetation can have an important influence on this energy exchange - particularly in terms of radiation. Although vegetated surfaces have a low albedo and thus absorb a large part of the solar radiation incident upon them, they can maintain lower temperatures than typical paved surfaces because they are cooled by evapotranspiration. The purpose of this research is to examine the cooling effect of "succulent" surface cover plants that are adapted to arid climates, in comparison to plants such as grass that require substantially more irrigation. The research site, in the Negev desert of southern Israel, consists of several small test plots with different species of succulents and other plants, along with dry ground surfaces. Measurements of surface temperature and albedo provide input for comprehensive pedestrian thermal comfort modeling using the Index of Thermal Stress, assuming an open space scenario with various surface cover treatments. Water requirements of the different plant are examined through an irrigation experiment. Results indicate that although there are thermal differences between the different plant types, these differences are small when compared with non-vegetated surfaces. While the non-succulents are slightly cooler and less stress-inducing than the desert-adapted plants, their water requirements are higher, making them less efficient in terms of the ratio between cooling "benefits" and water "costs"-both of which are expressed in terms of their equivalent energy.},

This study examines the impact of modifications in urban surface fractions of buildings, impervious and pervious surfaces on summer air temperatures using urban climate modelling of idealised cities. Sensitivity tests are performed for nine typical settlement types in Germany. The results for minimum and maximum temperatures are analysed and plotted in a ternary diagram. The novel approach of using ternary diagrams for the aggregation and visualisation of modelling results clearly identifies thermally unfavourable ranges of urban surface partitioning that should be avoided for urban settlements. Furthermore, the diagrams are used to derive quantitative recommendations for the most effective reduction of summer heat intensity.},

@article{Bodin2013,
abstract = {Accurate modelling of long-term changes in plant stomatal functioning is vital to global climate change studies because changes in evapotranspiration influence temperature via physiological forcing of the climate. Various stomatal models are included in land surface schemes, but their robustness over longer timescales is difficult to validate. We compare the performance of three stomatal models, varying in their degree of complexity, and coupled to a land surface model. This is carried out by simulating the carbon isotope ratio of tree leaves ($\delta$13Cleaf) over a period of 53 years, and comparing the results with carbon isotope ratios obtained from tree rings ($\delta$13Cstem) measured at six sites in northern Europe. All three stomatal models fail to capture the observed interannual variability in the measured $\delta$13Cstem time series. However, the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere (SPA) model performs significantly better than the Ball-Berry (BB) or COX models when tested for goodness-of-fit against measured $\delta$13Cstem. The $\delta$13Cleaf time series simulated using the SPA model are significantly positively correlated (P {\textless} 0.05) with measured results over the full time period tested, at all six sites. The SPA model underestimates interannual variability measured in $\delta$13Cstem, but is no worse than the BB model and significantly better than the COX model. The inability of current models to adequately replicate changes in stomatal response to rising levels of CO2 concentrations, and thus to quantify the associated physiological forcing, warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Knowledge of how the mean radiant temperature (T mrt ) is affected by factors such as location, climate and urban setting contributes to the practice of climate sensitive planning. This paper examines how T mrt varies within an urban setting and how it is influenced by cloudiness. In addition, variations of T mrt in three high latitude cities are investigated in order to analyse the impact of geographical context and climate conditions. Results showed large spatial variations between sunlit and shaded areas during clear weather conditions, with the highest values of T mrt close to sunlit walls and the lowest values in the areas shaded by buildings and vegetation. As cloudiness increases, the spatial pattern is altered and the differences are reduced. The highest T mrt under cloudy conditions is instead found in open areas where the proportion of shortwave diffuse radiation from the sky vault is high. A regional comparison between three Swedish coastal cities showed that T mrt during summer is similar regardless of latitudinal location. On the other hand, large differences in T mrt during winter were found. Shadows, both from buildings and vegetation are the most effective measure to reduce extreme values of T mrt . However, extensive areas of shadow are usually not desired within outdoor urban environments at high latitude cities. One solution is to create diverse outdoor urban spaces in terms of shadow and also ventilation. This would provide individuals with access to a choice of thermal environments which they can use to assist their thermal regulation, based on personal needs and desires.},

abstract = {An urban canopy model is developed for use in mesoscale meteorological and environmental modelling. The urban geometry is composed of simple homogeneous buildings characterized by the canyon aspect ratio (h/w) as well as the canyon vegetation characterized by the leaf aspect ratio ($\sigma$ l ) and leaf area density profile. Five energy exchanging surfaces (roof, wall, road, leaf, soil) are considered in the model, and energy conservation relations are applied to each component. In addition, the temperature and specific humidity of canopy air are predicted without the assumption of thermal equilibrium. For radiative transfer within the canyon, multiple reflections for shortwave radiation and one reflection for longwave radiation are considered, while the shadowing and absorption of radiation due to the canyon vegetation are computed by using the transmissivity and the leaf area density profile function. The model is evaluated using field measurements in Vancouver, British Columbia and Marseille, France. Results show that the model quite well simulates the observations of surface temperatures, canopy air temperature and specific humidity, momentum flux, net radiation, and energy partitioning into turbulent fluxes and storage heat flux. Sensitivity tests show that the canyon vegetation has a large influence not only on surface temperatures but also on the partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes. In addition, the surface energy balance can be affected by soil moisture content and leaf area index as well as the fraction of vegetation. These results suggest that a proper parameterization of the canyon vegetation is prerequisite for urban modelling.},

@article{Simmons2011,
abstract = {As environmental impacts and life-cycle costs (water use, water, fertilizer, pesticides and mowing) of the constructed landscape come under increasing scrutiny, the development of methods to reduce resource inputs for managed turf are increasingly important. While the use of a number of native turfgrass species as alternatives to non-natives has been previously examined, only a few are presently commercially available, and many species have been perceived as failing to perform to the level required by industry and consumers. Furthermore, the use of polycultures of native turfgrasses has not been extensively investigated, but could offer an alternative to the conventional lawn. We hypothesize that because native short grass species would be expected to be well-adapted to climate and soil conditions in areas with infrequent and erratic rainfall, their performance in terms of drought resistance, resilience to disturbance, and efficient resource use, will exceed that of a non-native species. Moreover, ecological theory predicts that a polyculture of coexisting native species may exhibit additional performance benefits. One native (Bouteloua dactyloides) and one commonly-used, non-native monoculture (Cynodon dactylon) and two native polyculture assemblages (two and seven species including B. dactyloides, Bouteloua gracilis, Bouteloua rigidiseta, Hilaria belangeri, Erioneuron pilosum, Bouteloua hirsuta, Sporobolus vaginiflorus) were compared for leaf density and weed resistance under two irrigation regimens, traffic regimes and mowing intensities. The native turfgrass and turfgrass assemblages generally had 30{\%} higher leaf densities in the early growing season, and up to 50{\%} lower weed density than the non-native monoculture. There was no difference among species tested in response to traffic or irrigation regimens, suggesting that all assemblages could be subjected to both higher traffic frequencies and reduced water inputs. Even though native species can have slower growth rates compared to the non-native species they maintained a higher or equivalent leaf density than the non-native turfgrass. This is a potentially important finding because of the large impact that mowing has on the total carbon footprint of turfgrass, and the corresponding reduction in that carbon footprint that could be realized through a reduced mowing frequency and corresponding reduction in life-cycle cost. This study suggests that regionally adapted native grass species are worth investigating as mono- and polycultures for performance advantages and lower resource inputs, and consequently may be suitable alternatives to conventional non-native turfgrasses in many applications. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Heudorf2005,
abstract = {Abstract An extreme heat wave in August 2003 had caused thousands of deaths all over Europe. Suitable prevention measures were demanded. The heat-associated mortality in Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, in summer 2003 is here analysed and published. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Death certificates issued in Frankfurt from June 1 (st) to August 31 (st) 2003 were checked with regard to sex, age, domestic situation and diagnosis. Mortality was compared to the daily temperature (mean, maximum, minimum temperature), measured online in Frankfurt by the Hessische Landesamt fur Umwelt und Geologie. RESULTS: In August 2003 there had been a heat wave in Europe with extreme temperatures. In Frankfurt, Germany, from 3 (rd) to 12 (th) August, maximum temperatures were constantly exceeding 35 degrees C, minimum temperatures being constantly above 21 degrees C. The death certificates of 1,487 deceased were analysed, 656 men and 831 women. In June, mortality was 14/day with a maximum of 21/day. From August 6 (th) onwards daily mortality increased sharply to a maximum of 51/day on August 13 (th). Mean daily mortality in August increased to 20.4/d, with regard to the first half of August up to 27.6/d. Excess mortality during this heat wave in Frankfurt was about 200 persons, about 100 living in old-age pensioners homes and about 100 living in their private homes. Excess mortality increased with age: compared to mean mortality in June/July 2003, in the first half of August excess in mortality was 66 {\%} for persons 60 - 70 years old, 100 {\%} for persons 70 - 80 year old, 128 {\%} in the age group 80 - 90 years and 146 {\%} in persons more than 90 years old. DISCUSSION: Our data demonstrate that there is a high risk of excess mortality among the elderly population during heat waves, also in Germany. Persons living in old-age pensioners homes are at risk as well as persons living in their private homes. Therefore prevention must be prepared by the public health services not only for those living in nursing homes but for those living in private homes as well.},

abstract = {We investigated the impacts of temperature changes derived from climate change scenarios and land cover change on patterns of external residential water consumption and nighttime cooling in suburban Hillsboro, Oregon. Three downscaled climate warming scenarios and two land cover change scenarios (sprawl and dense) for the 2040s were used as inputs for an urban energy balance model, the Local-Scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS). Based on the surface energy ﬂuxes simulated by the LUMPS model, we calculate that the combination of the sprawl scenario with the 3 ◦ C tempera- ture rise increases external water consumption by 4061 L per household for August. Alternately, dense development concomitant with temperature increase constrains increases in water consumption, but reduces nighttime cooling rates by more than 0.3 ◦ C. Increasing the fraction of trees would increase efﬁ- ciency in promoting urban cooling while reducing external water consumption. This study demonstrates that urban land cover and water use are naturally intertwined at the neighborhood scale, suggesting that urban land-use planning and water management should be fully integrated to design cities that can accommodate future population growth and development while minimizing negative impacts of potential climate change.},

abstract = {Since 2000, the benefits of walking as a mode of travel have been recognised by the New Zealand government in a raft of policy statements and strategies. However, the Ministry of Transport acknowledges that there are a number of issues to overcome to encourage more walking. This research focuses on one of the key issues: namely, the delay experienced by pedestrians at traffic signals. Historically, New Zealand's approach to pedestrian delay has been minimal, with pedestrian issues considered primarily from the point of view of safety, rather than level of service or amenity. At traffic signals, pedestrians are often accommodated in a way that causes the least amount of interruption to motorised traffic, and signal cycle times can be long, leading to excessive pedestrian waiting times. This can lead to frustration, causing pedestrians to violate the signals and use their own judgement to cross, resulting in safety risks. This research, which was carried out between 2007 and 2010 in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, used techniques such as pedestrian attitude surveys, micro-simulation modelling and a literature review of international best practice to identify methods of reducing pedestrian delay at signalised intersections in these cities. The recommendations developed during the course of the research provide both technical and policy mechanisms for improving pedestrian delay in New Zealand's central-city areas.},

abstract = {This study integrates i-Tree Eco model in order to estimate air pollution removal by urban trees in Strasbourg city, France. Applied for the first time in a French city, the model shows that public trees, i.e., trees managed by the city, removed about 88 t of pollutants during one year period (from July 2012 to June 2013): about 1 ton for CO; 14 tons for NO2; 56 tons for O3; 12 tons for PM10coarse (particles with diameter ranging from 2.5 to 10 ??m); 5 tons for PM2.5 and 1 ton for SO2. Air pollution removal varied mainly with the tree cover and the level of air pollutants concentrations. Comparison between simulated pollution removal rates and local emissions shows that public trees of Strasbourg reduce about 7{\%} of the emitted PM10coarse in the city's atmosphere; however, effect on other air pollutants is small. Thus, our study reveals that urban trees are a significant element to reduce air pollution but are not the only solution to this problem. It's then recommended to associate planting and managing urban forest resources to other strategies that take into account the urban environment characteristics: built structures, street design, location of local sources; etc.},

abstract = {With rising awareness of global warming and its consequences, greater efforts are being made to make our cities more sustainable.  Among many factors that can lead to more a sustainable future, policies encouraging walking and the use of public transportation can be considered as major priorities in planning.  There is a significant body of research concerning the process of rating the urban structure according to its ease of access for pedestrians and concerning the relationships between walking and public transportation.  However, there are few studies focused on the direct relationship between walking and Light Rail Transit (LRT). This study sought to understand the effect of the so-called walkability of urban areas on LRT usage in the USA and Japan.  To achieve this goal, an objective, an internationally applicable method for quantifying walkability, was devised using urban structure and street network data in the USA and Japan.  Walkability indices derived using this method were used to measure the effect of walkability in station areas on LRT ridership in both countries.  Results show that the urban structure around stations in Japanese cities can generally be considered more walkable than cities in the USA.  Moreover, station area walkability has a measurable effect on LRT usage, but only in the USA.},

abstract = {Land cover composition is a valuable indicator of the ecological performance of a city. Single-family housing areas constitute a substantial part of most cities and may as such play an important role for sustainable urban development. From aerial photos we performed detailed GIS-based mapping of land cover in three detached single-family housing areas in Denmark of different urban form but comparable housing densities (ranging from 10.0 to 11.3 houses per hectare). The findings were subjected to statistical analysis and landscape metrics. Land cover varied with urban form: A traditional spatial configuration with rectangular parcels contained significantly more vegetation and less impervious surfaces per parcel than newer Radburn-inspired configurations with more quadratic parcels. Correlation analysis showed size of paved access ways to be positively correlated with distance from road to carports in all parcels, and number of trees to be positively correlated with garden size in rectangular parcels. Correlation analysis also showed that higher trees were located further from houses, and that rectangular parcels could support more trees than quadratic parcels. These results suggest that the urban form of neighbourhoods to some degree predicts the long term land cover composition. We conclude that strategies for maximizing the ecological performance of single-family housing areas can be informed by knowledge on urban form, and that digital mapping of land cover based on aerial photography is a useful tool. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Forests are critical for the world's biodiversity, the regulation of the Earth's climate, and the provision of goods and services for humans. This review focuses on four broad topics: (1) key processes threatening forest biodiversity; (2) broad strategies for mitigating threatening processes; (3) climate change and forest biodiversity; and, (4) plantations and biodiversity. How key issues within these broad topics are addressed will have profound effects on forest biodiversity and the Earth's climate. A significant global problem for biodiversity conservation is the conversion of natural forests to other land uses, both in developing and developed nations; ways must be urgently identified to halt forest conversion. When forests are logged for timber or pulpwood and then regenerated, impacts on biodiversity are harder to quantify than when forests are converted to other land uses. Hence, the effectiveness of efforts to mitigate such impacts (where they occur) is frequently not well known. Climate change may result in substantial changes to forest ecosystems, and its effects may interact in additive or cumulative ways with other human disturbances in forests, although work on such combinations of impacts is in its infancy. The establishment of plantations of trees is frequently proposed to sequester large amounts of carbon and/or produce biofuels to mitigate the climate-change effects. However, there is potential for perverse outcomes, such as biodiversity loss where plantation establishment is narrowly focused and other environmental values are ignored.},

@article{Pelupessy2016,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this paper we present the Oceanographic Multipurpose Software Environment (OMUSE). This framework aims to provide a homogeneous environment for existing or newly developed numerical ocean simulation codes, simplifying their use and deployment. In this way, OMUSE facilitates the design of numerical experiments that combine ocean models representing different physics or spanning different ranges of physical scales. Rapid development of simulation models is made possible through the creation of simple high-level scripts, with the low-level core part of the abstraction designed to deploy these simulations efficiently on heterogeneous high performance computing resources. Cross-verification of simulation models with different codes and numerical methods is facilitated by the unified interface that OMUSE provides. Reproducibility in numerical experiments is fostered by allowing complex numerical experiments to be expressed in portable scripts that conform to a common OMUSE interface. Here, we present the design of OMUSE as well as the modules and model components currently included, which range from a simple conceptual quasi-geostrophic solver, to the global circulation model POP. We discuss the types of the couplings that can be implemented using OMUSE and present example applications, that demonstrate the efficient and relatively straightforward model initialisation and coupling within OMUSE. These also include the concurrent use of data analysis tools on a running model. We also give examples of multi-scale and multi-physics simulations by embedding a regional ocean model into a global ocean model, and in coupling a surface wave propagation model with a coastal circulation model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The emissions growth rate since 2000 was greater than for the most fossil-fuel intensive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenarios developed in the late 1990s. Global emissions growth since 2000 was driven by a cessation or reversal of earlier declining trends in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (energy/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions/energy), coupled with continuing increases in population and per-capita GDP. Nearly constant or slightly increasing trends in the carbon intensity of energy have been recently observed in both developed and developing regions. No region is decarbonizing its energy supply. The growth rate in emissions is strongest in rapidly developing economies, particularly China. Together, the developing and least-developed economies (forming 80{\%} of the world's population) accounted for 73{\%} of global emissions growth in 2004 but only 41{\%} of global emissions and only 23{\%} of global cumulative emissions since the mid-18th century. The results have implications for global equity.},

abstract = {AbstractAccessibility has long been considered as an important factor that influences activity generation, especially nonwork activities. However, the conclusions on whether greater accessibility leads to more travel have been mixed. One reason for the conflicting results is that individual heterogeneity is not taken into account in the previous location-based accessibility measures. This paper fills this gap by operationalizing a person-based space-time accessibility (STA) measure based on the individual's spatial-temporal constraints. A discrete-continuous model of shopping activity participation and duration is developed incorporating this STA measure in order to investigate the influences of accessibility on activity generation. Using data from a global positioning system (GPS)–based activity travel survey from the Shangdi area of Beijing, China, this paper confirms that accessibility remains a significant positive effect on shopping activity generation. This implies that an individual's spatial-tempo...},

Specific temperature-dependence parameters of the model for olive leaves were measured, as well as the relationship of the model parameters with area-based leaf nitrogen (N) content. The effect of soil water deficit on leaf photosynthesis was examined by applying two irrigation treatments to 29-year-old trees growing in a plantation: drip irrigation sufficient to meet the crop water requirements (I) and dry-farming (D). In both treatments, leaves had a higher photosynthetic capacity in April than in August. In August, photosynthetic capacity was lower in D trees than in I trees. Leaf photosynthetic capacity was linearly and positively related to leaf N content on an area basis (N(a)) and to leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and the regression slope varied with irrigation treatment. The seasonal reduction in N(a) was used in the model to predict photosynthesis under drought conditions. Olive leaves showed a clear limitation of photosynthesis by triose phosphate utilization (TPU) even at 40 degrees C, and the data suggest that olive invests fewer resources in TPU than other species. The seasonal decrease in photosynthetic capacity moderated the stomatal limitation to carbon dioxide (CO(2)) fixation as soil water deficit increased. Further, it enabled leaves to operate close to the transition point between photosynthetic limitation due to RuBP carboxylation capacity and that due to RuBP regeneration capacity, and resulted in a near constant value of internal CO(2) concentration from April to August. Under well watered conditions, N-use efficiency of the olive leaves was enhanced at the expense of reduced water-use efficiency.},

abstract = {Creating ‘liveable' communities that are healthy and sustainable is an aspiration of policymakers in Australia and overseas. Indicators are being used at the national, state and local level to compare the liveability of cities and regions. Yet, there are challenges in the adoption of such indicators. Planning scholars see a challenge in creating indicators that measure something publicly valued, while public health researchers are concerned about scant systemic research on relationships between policies, the built environment, and health and well-being. This article provides an overview of liveability indicators used to date in Australia and internationally. It then outlines the results of consultations with Melbourne-based academics and decision-makers, on how to increase their utility and support the creation of healthy, liveable and sustainable cities.},

abstract = {Tree microclimate and human thermal comfort are important for urban residents in summer as trees can improve street microclimate for pedestrians through shade and transpiration. It is important to know how trees provide microclimate and human thermal benefits and in what circumstances they provide the most benefit to the urban environment. This thesis provides greater understanding as to the influence of extreme heat weather events on street microclimate and human thermal comfort. The assessment of street microclimate modification under the trees was done in all studies through measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt) and wind speed. The human-biometeorological index of Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was used for the assessment of human thermal comfort. Cooling benefits from trees depend upon the percentage of canopy cover, street orientation, the side of the street being assessed and time of the day. The air temperature in treed streets could be 2.1°C cooler, and the human thermal comfort perceived by pedestrians could be 4.6°C cooler in high-canopy cover streets than in low-canopy cover streets. These microclimate benefits were greatly influenced by the street orientation due to the influence of sun's zenith. In addition, the differences in cooling benefit amongst three different tree species were primarily determined by the difference in the cumulative shade provided by leaves, branches and twigs are important in determining the microclimate and human thermal comfort benefits from trees. These differences were captured and quantified using digital full frame photography from which Plant Canopy Area Index (PCAI) was estimated underneath individual tree canopies. Platanus x acerifolia trees were the most prone to leaf loss due to a heat wave event compared to Ulmus procera and Eucalyptus scoparia with 44{\%} of the canopy lost. This canopy loss of P. acerifolia due to the heat wave event also changed the cooling benefits of the P. acerifolia trees and lead to a PET benefit reduction from 6.6°C to 1.6°C after the heat wave. This thesis has been successful in identifying and quantifying some of the key factors that influence street microclimate and human thermal comfort benefits provided by trees. The research outcomes from this thesis contribute to the knowledge and future direction of urban forest planning and management in particular for the provision of ecosystem services provided by street trees in the form of microclimate and human thermal comfort benefits.},

Olive-crop yields, phenolic compounds progress, phytotoxicity and microbial counts were studied at different soil depths. Olive yield showed improvements with OMW level applied. Soil polyphenolic content increased progressively in relation to OMW levels in all the investigated layers. However, no significant difference was noted in lowest treatment rate compared to the control field. In the soil upper-layers (0-40cm), five phenolic compounds were identified over six consecutive years of OMW-spraying. In all the soil-layers, the radish germination index exceeded 85{\%}. However, tomato germination test values decreased with the applied OMW amount. For all treatments, microbial counts increased with OMW quantities and spraying frequency. Matrix correlation showed a strong relationship between soil polyphenol content and microorganisms, and a negative one to tomato germination index. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Baldauf2012,
abstract = {In response to growing public health concerns regarding elevated air pollutant exposures and adverse human health effects for near-road populations, a study was conducted to assess how complex urban roadway conﬁgurations affect local-scale air quality. This study combined ﬁxed-site and mobile air quality measurements with laboratory wind tunnel experiments to examine how the transport and dispersion of trafﬁc-emitted pollutants varies with changing roadway conﬁguration, notably with at- grade and cut section designs. Results of the study indicated that short-term maximum concentra- tions occurred with measurements made along at-grade locations, however, average concentrations tended to be higher at the top of the cut section compared with the at-grade location, most often occurring during lower air pollutant events. Wind ﬂow and NO2/NOx ratios indicated that the cut section moderated peak concentrations through increased transport and dispersion, as well as reducing the inﬂuence of turbulence from vehicle activity near the road. The at-grade locations also experienced a higher impact from primary vehicle emissions than those measurements made at similar distances along a cut section. Mobile monitoring suggested that these peak concentrations quickly conformed to concentration levels measured near cut sections within 50e100 m of the source highway. Wind tunnel simulations of the study site with and without the cut section present indicated that the cut section reduced the concentrations of primary emitted vehicle pollutants by 15e25 percent for receptors located approximately 20 m from the highway. The wind tunnel simulations also revealed that buildings and other urban features inﬂuenced local-scale pollutant transport and need to be consid- ered when evaluating near-road air quality.},

abstract = {Since early 1990s, the development of footprint models has been rapid with presently four different approaches being available: (i) analytical models, (ii) Lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion models, (iii) large-eddy simulations, and (iv) closure models. Parameterizations of some of these approaches have been developed, simplifying the original algorithms for use in practical applications. The paper provides a review of the footprint modelling. It also discusses our present understanding of the theoretical background, the most successful modelling approaches, as well as the usage and benefits of the footprint concept as it relates to flux measurements. There has recently been a trend emerging in modelling the behavior of the footprint functions using a less idealized, more realistic description of inhomogeneities, vegetation structure and topography, ultimately for reactive compounds. The estimation of footprints for application in the real world, complete with a multitude of interesting gaseous and particulate substances, remains a complex problem. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Countless cities are rapidly developing across the globe, pressing the need for clear urban-planning and design recommendations geared toward sustainability. This paper examines the intersections of Jane Jacobs' four conditions for diversity with low-carbon and low- energy-use urban systems in four cities around the world: Lyon (France), Chicago (Illinois), Kolkata (India), and Singapore City (Singapore). After reviewing Jacobs' four conditions for diversity, the four cities are introduced and their historical development context is described. A framework to study the cities along the following three dimensions is then presented: population and density, infrastructure development/ use, and climate and landscape. These cities differ in many respects and their analysis is instructive for many other cities around the globe. Jacobs' conditions are present in all of them, manifested in different ways and to varying degrees. Overall, the study results show that the adoption of Jacobs' conditions seems to align well with concepts of low-carbon urban systems, with their focus on walkability, transit- oriented design, and more efficient land use (i.e., smaller unit sizes). Transportation-sector emissions seem to demonstrate a stronger influence from the presence of Jacobs' conditions, whereas the link was less pronounced in the building sector. Kolkata, a low-income, developing world city, seems to possess many of Jacobs' conditions, while exhibiting low per-capita emissions—maintaining both of these during its economic expansion will take careful consideration. Greenhouse-gas mitigation, however, is inherently an in situ problem and the first task must therefore be to gain local knowledge of an area before developing strategies to lower its carbon footprint.

abstract = {In the last decades, several studies have revealed how critical the urban heat island (UHI) effect can be in cities located in cold climates, such as the Canadian one. Meanwhile, many researchers have looked at the impact of the city design over the urban microclimate, and have raised concerns about the development of too dense cities. Under the effect of the " Places to Growth " plan, the city of Toronto is experiencing one of the highest rates of building development in North America. Over 48,000 and 33,000 new home permits were issued in 2012 and 2013 respectively, and at the beginning of 2015, almost 500 high-rise proposals across the Greater Toronto Area were released. In this context, it is important to investigate how new constructions will affect the urban microclimate, and to propose strategies to mitigate possible UHI effects. Using the software ENVI-met, microclimate simulations for the Church-Yonge corridor both in the current situation and with the new constructions are reported in this paper. The outdoor air temperature and the wind speed are the parameters used to assess the outdoor microclimate changes. The results show that the new constructions could increase the wind speed around the buildings. However, high-rise buildings will somewhat reduce the air temperature during day-time, as they will create large shadow areas, with lower average mean radiant temperature.},

abstract = {Urban vegetation affects air quality through influencing pollutant deposition and dispersion. Both processes are described by many existing models and experiments, on-site and in wind tunnels, focussing e.g. on urban street canyons and crossings or vegetation barriers adjacent to traffic sources. There is an urgent need for well-structured experimental data, including detailed empirical descriptions of parameters that are not the explicit focus of the study.This review revealed that design and choice of urban vegetation is crucial when using vegetation as an ecosystem service for air quality improvements. The reduced mixing in trafficked street canyons on adding large trees increases local air pollution levels, while low vegetation close to sources can improve air quality by increasing deposition. Filtration vegetation barriers have to be dense enough to offer large deposition surface area and porous enough to allow penetration, instead of deflection of the air stream above the barrier. The choice between tall or short and dense or sparse vegetation determines the effect on air pollution from different sources and different particle sizes.},

abstract = {The potential to moderate travel demand through changes in the built environment is the subject of more than 50 recent empirical studies. The majority of recent studies are summarized. Elasticities of travel demand with respect to density, diversity, design, and regional accessibility are then derived from selected studies. These elasticity values may be use- ful in travel forecasting and sketch planning and have already been incorporated into one sketch planning tool, the Environmental Protec- tion Agency's Smart Growth Index model. In weighing the evidence, what can be said, with a degree of certainty, about the effects of built environments on key transportation “outcome” variables: trip fre- quency, trip length, mode choice, and composite measures of travel demand, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT)? Trip frequencies have attracted considerable academic interest of late. They appear to be primarily a function of socioeconomic char- acteristics of travelers and secondarily a function of the built environ- ment. Trip lengths have received relatively little attention, which may account for the various degrees of importance attributed to the built environment in recent studies. Trip lengths are primarily a function of the built environment and secondarily a function of socioeconomic char- acteristics. Mode choices have received the most intensive study over the decades. Mode choices depend on both the built environment and socioeconomics (although they probably depend more on the latter). Studies of overall VMT or VHT find the built environment to be much more significant, a product of the differential trip lengths that factor into calculations of VMT and VHT.},

abstract = {As the frequency and intensity of heatwaves are growing in Australia, strategies to combat heat are becoming more vital. Cities are exposed to urban heat islands (UHIs) due to excess urbanisation. In this study, a definition of urban heatwave (UHW) is conceptualised to investigate the combined impacts of heatwaves and UHIs. To quantify the negative impacts of UHW, indicators—such as excess morbidity, electricity and water consumption—are considered. The intensity of UHWs is calculated using the unit of excess heat factor (EHF), developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. EHF enables the comparability of UHWs in different geographical locations. Using the indicators and the intensity of UHWs, a calculation method to quantify heatwave resilience at a precincts scale is proposed. The study summarises the assumed influential factors of precinct heatwave resilience based on the existing literature and propose a “cool retrofitting toolkit” (CRT). CRT creates the framework to assess the adaptation to and mitigation of UHWs available to retrofit existing precincts, and to evaluate potential retrofitting strategies in terms of energy and carbon efficiency, financial affordability and perceived acceptability by population. This study illuminates the importance of climate, function, built environment and population characteristics-conscious retrofitting.},

abstract = {Many previous studies have investigated the role of urban greening (especially trees) on thermal comfort condition of open spaces while its influence in street canyons has, however, received relatively lower research attention. In this study, numerical experiments involving street canyons of varying aspect ratio (ARB) with embedded trees of varying aspect ratio (ART), leaf area index (LAI), leaf area density (LAD) distribution and trunk height under different wind conditions were conducted using a micro-meteorological model, ENVI-met. Employing physiological equivalent temperature (PET), the in-canyon thermal comfort was characterized. Results show variable magnitude of PET reduction (??PET) with trees of different vertical LAD distribution even though they are of similar LAI. While larger tree-covered area (TCA) ensures improved thermal comfort, the magnitude varies with tree-planting pattern. Between the tree-planting patterns in TCA = 0.6, ??PET with double-rows is higher than centre tree-planting. Between eastern and western side tree-planting (TCA = 0.3), the former is more temporally effective than the latter. Furthermore, strong oblique wind condition ("without trees") was found to be more efficient in improving thermal comfort than trees under calm perpendicular wind, reinstating the importance of desirable ventilation in achieving a thermally comfortable environment. However, vegetation offers improved PET reduction under calmer perpendicular than stronger oblique wind condition. Finally, recommendations on applications of our key findings were presented.},

No. 1, 36–58, February 2013 Green-Networks: Integrating Alternative Circulation Systems into Post-industrial Cities KARL KULLMANN Department of Landscape Architecture, Environmental Planning / Graduate Group of Urban Design, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA ABSTRACT Many post-industrial cities are infused with ready-made spaces for non- vehicular circulation in the formof webs of linear voids that often result from industrial era infrastructure. There have been many successful conversions of individual linear easements into greenways, although attempting to craft continuous green-networks from these residual spaces is often problematic. This paper considers how designers and planners might start to reconcile the aspirations of the green-network as a model and an idea with the actual opportunities on the ground as typically found in post-industrial cities. Central to the discussion is an extension of Robert Searns' greenway generational rubric, whereby the present generation of greenways is described as complete webs to rival the grey infrastructure of the incumbent city fabric. Within this framework, the paper elaborates on a number of themes: (1) how effective green-networks are at influencing urban form; (2) the green-network as a counterbalance to the city; (3) speed versus slowness; (4) issues of intersection and grade separation; (5) the concept of interwoven green/grey space; and (6) the greenway network model versus the standalone circuit. The paper concludes with a call for expanding the greenway nomenclature to reflect the actual diversity of the genre.},

abstract = {Debate continues over bicycle helmet laws. Proponents argue that case-control studies of voluntary wearing show helmets reduce head injuries. Opponents argue, even when legislation substantially increased percent helmet wearing, there was no obvious response in percentages of cyclist hospital admissions with head injury-trends for cyclists were virtually identical to those of other road users. Moreover, enforced laws discourage cycling, increasing the costs to society of obesity and lack of exercise and reducing overall safety of cycling through reduced safety in numbers. Countries with low helmet wearing have more cyclists and lower fatality rates per kilometre. Cost-benefit analyses are a useful tool to determine if interventions are worthwhile. The two published cost-benefit analyses of helmet law data found that the cost of buying helmets to satisfy legislation probably exceeded any savings in reduced head injuries. Analyses of other road safety measures, e.g. reducing speeding and drink-driving or treating accident blackspots, often show that benefits are significantly greater than costs. Assuming all parties agree that helmet laws should not be implemented unless benefits exceed costs, agreement is needed on how to derive monetary values for the consequences of helmet laws, including changes in injury rates, cycle-use and enjoyment of cycling. Suggestions are made concerning the data and methodology needed to help clarify the issue, e.g. relating pre- and post-law surveys of cycle use to numbers with head and other injuries and ensuring that trends are not confused with effects of increased helmet wearing.},

abstract = {AbstractLink level annual average daily traffic (AADT) or travel demand is used in several urban planning, roadway design, operational, and safety analyses by transportation planners and engineers. Existing AADT estimation methods do not adequately account for spatial proximity, variations, and dependency to address modeling needs. The primary focus of this paper, therefore, is to incorporate these aspects and develop a method to estimate link level AADT by the urban road functional class. Geospatial analytical techniques were explored to capture spatial data within proximal areas of selected roadway links and develop statistical models to estimate link level AADT. Polygon-based network buffers were generated within the proximal roadway distance of each study link to account for actual connectivity and capture off-network data instead of Euclidean distance-based buffers. On-network characteristics of the study links and upstream, downstream, and cross-street network links were considered to account for the spatial dependency of on-network characteristics. The applicability of the method and predictive capability of the models to estimate link level AADT, considering all of the selected study links and by each road functional class, was researched. The working of the method and development of the models is illustrated using data for the city of Charlotte in the state of North Carolina. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) models developed indicate that a negative binomial distribution fits better than a Poisson distribution for the data considered in this research. The ideal proximal distance to capture spatial data and accurately estimate AADT was observed to vary when all study links and different road functional classes were modeled separately. Overall, the results obtained indicate that spatial proximity and dependency play a vital role in accurately estimating travel demand on various urban road functional classes.},

@article{Cicchino2014,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pedestrians represent more than one third of all traffic deaths in Washington, D.C. The District plans to expand its long-standing automated traffic enforcement program in 2013 from speed and red light cameras to cameras to enforce pedestrian right-of-way laws at crosswalks and stop sign laws. This study collected information on the opinions, behaviors, and knowledge of D.C. residents related to camera enforcement and pedestrian safety issues. METHODS: A telephone survey of 801 adult D.C. residents was conducted in November 2012 with approximately equal numbers of respondents in each of D.C.'s eight wards. Quotas were used to ensure that the sample was representative of the demographic characteristics of adults in each ward. For analyses combining responses across the wards, data were weighted to correspond with the demographic characteristics of adults in the city. RESULTS: Most respondents believed that drivers speeding, running red lights, running stop signs, and not stopping for pedestrians are serious threats to their safety. Respondents strongly supported the speed and red light camera programs, with 76 percent of respondents favoring speed cameras and 87 percent favoring red light cameras. Support was more limited for the camera enforcement that was not yet in place at the time of the survey, with 50 percent of respondents favoring stop sign cameras and 47 percent of respondents favoring crosswalk cameras. Twenty-four percent of respondents had not driven a car in D.C. in the past month, and higher proportions of these nondrivers favored speed cameras (90{\%}), stop sign cameras (67{\%}), and crosswalk cameras (59{\%}) than respondents who drove in D.C. in the past month. Respondents who supported camera enforcement cited safety as their main reason. More than 9 in 10 respondents knew that D.C. law requires drivers to stop for pedestrians crossing the street in marked crosswalks at intersections without traffic signals and midblock, but only 54 percent knew that drivers must stop for pedestrians crossing the street at intersections without marked crosswalks. CONCLUSIONS: Most residents supported speed cameras and red light cameras, but support was lower for stop sign and crosswalk cameras. Emphasizing the safety benefits of stop sign and crosswalk cameras and documenting the extent of safety problems at stop signs and crosswalks may increase support for these new forms of camera enforcement. Communities considering automated enforcement should take into account the opinions of pedestrians, even though they are not subject to camera citations.},

abstract = {The multitude of quality of life problems associated with declining walking rates has impelled researchers from various disciplines to identify factors related to this behavior change. Currently, this body of research is in need of a trans- disciplinary, multilevel theoretical model that can help explain howindividual, group, regional, and physical-environmental factors all affect physical activity behaviors.To address this gap, this article offers a social-ecological model ofwalking that presents a dynamic, causal model of the decision-making process.Within the model, a hierarchy of walking needs operates and organizes five levels of needs hierarchically and presents them as antecedents within the walking decision-making process. This model can (a) serve as a framework by which to understand the relative significance of the cornucopia of variables identified by existing research, (b) offer hypotheses for how these factors affect peoples' decision to walk, and (c) help to guide future research and practice.},

@article{Attewell2001,
abstract = {Bicycle helmet efficacy was quantified using a formal meta-analytic approach based on peer-reviewed studies. Only those studies with individual injury and helmet use data were included. Based on studies from several countries published in the period 1987-1998, the summary odds ratio estimate for efficacy is 0.40 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.29, 0.55) for head injury, 0.42 (0.26, 0.67) for brain injury, 0.53 (0.39, 0.73) for facial injury and 0.27 (0.10, 0.71) for fatal injury. This indicates a statistically significant protective effect of helmets. Three studies provided neck injury results that were unfavourable to helmets with a summary estimate of 1.36 (1.00, 1.86), but this result may not be applicable to the lighter helmets currently in use. In conclusion, the evidence is clear that bicycle helmets prevent serious injury and even death. Despite this, the use of helmets is sub-optimal. Helmet use for all riders should be further encouraged to the extent that it is uniformly accepted and analogous to the use of seat belts by motor vehicle occupants.},

abstract = {a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t Available online xxxx Outdoor human comfort is an essential parameter to assess the quality of the urban microclimate, and to provide guidelines for sustainable urban development. This paper presents a comprehensive review of available tools for modelling outdoor human comfort and thermal stress, explains the physical equations that drive these models, and shows their applicability based on climate and the findings of previous research. The existing procedures are subdivided into three main cate-gories: Thermal indices, Empirical indices and indices based on Linear Equations; for each approach, case studies are presented and subdivided according to Koeppen Climatic Classification (Polar, Cold, Temperate, Arid and Tropical). International regulations and software available to quantify outdoor human comfort and microclimate are presented, as well as a graphic thermal scale to compare the ability of each procedure to respond to the 11-point thermal sensation scale (from Sweltering to Extremely Cold). Finally, the models are presented as function of their ability to analyse climate, microclimate and human-related characteris-tics of the selected built environment. This paper aims at bringing a comprehensive introduction to the topic of the outdoor human comfort, helping the reader to understand the existing procedures and guiding the choice of the suitable options according to specific research needs.},

abstract = {Urban canopy parametrizations designed to be coupled with mesoscale models must predict the integrated effect of urban obstacles on the flow at each height in the canopy. To assess these neighbourhood-scale effects, results of microscale simulations may be horizontally-averaged. Obstacle-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of neutrally-stratified flow through canopies of blocks (buildings) with varying distributions and densities of porous media (tree foliage) are conducted, and the spatially-averaged impacts on the flow of these building-tree combinations are assessed. The accuracy with which a one-dimensional (column) model with a one-equation ({\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}k–{\$}{\$}l{\$}{\$}l) turbulence scheme represents spatially-averaged CFD results is evaluated. Individual physical mechanisms by which trees and buildings affect flow in the column model are evaluated in terms of relative importance. For the treed urban configurations considered, effects of buildings and trees may be considered independently. Building drag coefficients and length scale effects need not be altered due to the presence of tree foliage; therefore, parametrization of spatially-averaged flow through urban neighbourhoods with trees is greatly simplified. The new parametrization includes only source and sink terms significant for the prediction of spatially-averaged flow profiles: momentum drag due to buildings and trees (and the associated wake production of turbulent kinetic energy), modification of length scales by buildings, and enhanced dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy due to the small scale of tree foliage elements. Coefficients for the Santiago and Martilli (Boundary-Layer Meteorol 137: 417–439, 2010) parametrization of building drag coefficients and length scales are revised. Inclusion of foliage terms from the new parametrization in addition to the Santiago and Martilli building terms reduces root-mean-square difference (RMSD) of the column model streamwise velocity component and turbulent kinetic energy relative to the CFD model by 89 {\%} in the canopy and 71 {\%} above the canopy on average for the highest leaf area density scenarios tested: {\$}{\$}0.50$\backslash$hbox {\{} m{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\~{}}$\backslash$hbox {\{}m{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}{\$}0.50m2 m-3. RMSD values with the new parametrization are less than 20 {\%} of mean layer magnitude for the streamwise velocity component within and above the canopy, and for above-canopy turbulent kinetic energy; RMSD values for within-canopy turbulent kinetic energy are negligible for most scenarios. The foliage-related portion of the new parametrization is required for scenarios with tree foliage of equal or greater height than the buildings, and for scenarios with foliage below roof height for building plan area densities less than approximately 0.25.},

This project has developed operational definitions and measurement protocols for subtler urban design qualities believed to be related to walkability. Methods: Methods included: 1) recruiting an expert panel; 2) shooting video clips of streetscapes; 3) rating urban design qualities of streetscapes by the expert panel; 4) measuring physical features of streetscapes from the video clips; 5) testing inter-rater reliability of physical measurements and urban design quality ratings; 6) statistically analyzing relationships between physical features and urban design quality ratings, 7) selecting of qualities for operationalization, and 8) developing of operational definitions and measurement protocols for urban design qualities based on statistical relationships. Results: Operational definitions and measurement protocols were developed for five of nine urban design qualities: imageability, visual enclosure, human scale, transparency, and complexity. Conclusions: A field survey instrument has been developed, tested in the field, and further refined for use in active living research.},

abstract = {This research aims to investigate pedestrians traffic gap acceptance for mid-block street crossing in urban areas. In particular, two aspects of pedestrians crossing behaviour at mid- block locations are examined, namely the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians and the decision or not to cross the street, as well as the related determinants. For this purpose, a field survey was carried out at an uncontrolled mid-block location in the centre of Athens, Greece. In this survey, pedestrians crossing decisions were videotaped in real traffic conditions. At the same time, the speed of incoming vehicles was measured by means of speed guns. The data collected included the number and the size of traffic gaps rejected or accepted by pedestrians, the related waiting times and number of crossing attempts, the vehicle's speed, as well as individual characteristics (gender, age etc.). A lognormal regression model was then developed in order to examine the effect of various parameters on pedestrian gap acceptance, defined as the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians. It was found that pedestrian's gap acceptance was better explained by the distance from the incoming vehicle, rather than its speed. Moreover, the presence of illegally parked vehicles (which may affect pedestrians' visibility), the size of the incoming vehicle and the presence of other pedestrians were found to have important effect on the size of traffic gaps accepted by pedestrians. A binary logistic model was also developed in order to examine the effect of the traffic gaps available and of other parameters on the decision of pedestrians to cross the street or not. The modeling results reveal that this type of crossing decision is largely defined by the distance from the incoming vehicles and the waiting time of pedestrians.},

abstract = {In this study, the impact of different urban development scenarios on neighbourhood climate are examined. The investigation considers the relative impact differing policy/planning choices will have on the local-scale climate across a city during a typical climatological year (TCY). The aim is to demonstrate a modelling approach which couples a climate-based land classification and simple urban climate model and how this can be used to examine the impact differing urban forms and design strategies have on neighbourhood scale partitioning of energy and resulting consequences. Utilising the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance (SUEWS) model (. J??rvi et al., 2011) hourly fluxes of sensible, latent and stored heat are simulated for an entire year under four different urban development scenarios. The land cover scenarios are based on those obtained by the MOLAND model for 2026 (. Brennan et al., 2009) in our case study city Dublin (Ireland). MOLAND LULC are translated into local climate zones (. Stewart and Oke, 2012) for examination. Subsequently, the types of building forms, vegetation type and coverage are modified based on realistic examples currently found across Dublin city. Our results focused on 2 principle aspects: the seasonality of energy partitioning with respect to vegetation and average diurnal partitioning of energy. Our analysis illustrates that compact scenarios are suitable form of future urban development in terms of reducing the spatial impact on the existing surface energy budget in Dublin. Design interventions which maintain the level of vegetation at a ratio ??? 9:16 to artificial surfaces reduces the impact.},

The metamodel predicting daily TR was validated using one year of sap flow measurements and showed close agreement with the measurements (mean percentage error = 11{\%}, n = 2155).

abstract = {Australia is facing serious challenges in the management of water in various urban and regional locations. Two popular responses to these challenges are increasing supply through alternative water sources such as recycled and desalinated water. However, significant gaps exist in our knowledge of community attitudes to these alternative sources of water, particularly for potable use. This paper reports results from an Australian study of community attitudes to alternative water sources. Sixty six qualitative interviews were held at eight locations with distinctly different water situations. This paper explores all three antecedents to the behaviour of drinking recycled water and desalinated water as postulated by the Theory of Planned Behaviour: attitudes, social norms and factors of perceived behavioural control. Key results indicate that while people hold both positive and negative beliefs (mostly cost, health and environmental concerns) about water from alternative sources, nearly all of them are willing to drink it if the water crisis were to deteriorate further. People also feel they lack knowledge and state that information from scientists would influence their decision to drink recycled and desalinated water most. Friends and relatives are most influential in preventing people from drinking recycled water. The findings reported in this paper have major implications for water policy, and will be of particular interest to water engineers. The paper raises a provocative question: Is it better to avoid public consultation in introducing water from alternative sources?},

abstract = {Abstract In an introductory review it is reemphasized that the large-scale parameterization of the surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat is properly expressed in terms of energetic considerations over land while formulas of the bulk aerodynamic type are most suitahle over the sea. A general framework is suggested. Data from a number of saturated land sites and open water sites in the absence of advection suggest a widely applicable formula for the relationship between sensible and latent heat fluxes. For drying land surfaces, we assume that the evaporation rate is given by the same formula for evaporation multiplied by a factor. This factor is found to remain at unity while an amount of water, varying from one site to another, is evaporated. Following this a linear decrease sets in, reducing the evaporation rate to zero after a further 5 cm of evaporation, the same at several sites examined.},

abstract = {Plant transpiration is strongly constrained by hydraulic architecture, which determines the critical threshold for cavitation. Because species vary greatly in vulnerability to cavitation, hydraulic limits to transpiration and stomatal conductance have not generally been incorporated into ecological and climate models. We measured sap flow, leaf transpiration, and vulnerability to cavitation of a variety of tree species in a well-irrigated but semi-arid urban environment in order to evaluate the generality of stomatal responses to high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D). We found evidence of broad patterns of stomatal responses to humidity based on systematic differences in vulnerability to cavitation. Ring-porous taxa consistently had vulnerable xylem and showed strong regulation of transpiration in response to D, while diffuse-porous taxa were less vulnerable and transpiration increased nearly linearly with D. These results correspond well to patterns in the distribution of the taxa, such as the prevalence of diffuse-porous species in riparian ecosystems, and also provide a means of representing maximum transpiration rates at varying D in broad categories of trees.},

abstract = {Objective: Legislation is an effective strategy for reducing road-related fatalities and injuries. Public opinion can be an impetus for passing new laws and can affect the success of their implementation, but little is known about the current state of public opinion toward existing and proposed road-related policies in the United States. This review describes the scope and results of research on public support for state- and local-level evidence-based motor vehicle- and bicycle-related policies. We identify gaps in our understanding of public support for these policies. Methods: Published U.S. literature and all reports from the NHTSA from the past decade (2003-2012) were searched for data on opinions about existing or proposed policies related to motor vehicle or bicycle injury prevention. Twenty-six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In all, studies reported public opinion about 7 injury prevention topic areas: all-terrain vehicles (n = 1), automated enforcement with red light and speed cameras (n = 5), distracted driving (n = 4), drinking and driving (n = 5), graduated driver licensing (n = 7), helmets (n = 7), and seat belts (n = 4). Twenty-three studies focused only on one topic, and 3 sought public opinion about multiple topic areas. Results: The studies revealed generally high levels of support for injury prevention policies in all topic areas. Fifteen studies collected information from national samples, and only 7 studies reported data from the state (n = 5) or local (n = 2) level. Conclusions: There is a relatively small evidence base on public opinion related to motor vehicle- and bicycle-related evidence-based policies; even less is less known for state- or county-specific policies. The findings of this review suggest that the public's opinion toward injury prevention legislation is generally favorable. This information can be used to communicate with the media and policy makers to reinforce the need for effective policy solutions to continuing motor vehicle injury problems. More research is needed to understand the perspectives of those who do not hold favorable opinions, to understand opinions toward local or state-level policies, and to monitor trends in public opinion over time.

abstract = {This paper presents the comparative analysis between the findings from two field surveys of human thermal conditions in outdoor urban spaces during the summer season. The first survey was carried out from August 2010 to May 2011 in Singapore and the second survey was carried out from June 2010 to August 2010 in Changsha, China. The physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) was utilized as the thermal index to assess the thermal conditions. Differences were found between the two city respondents in terms of thermal sensation, humidity sensation, and wind speed sensation. No big difference was found between the two city respondents regarding the sun sensation. The two city respondents had similar neutral PET of 28.1 °C for Singapore and 27.9 °C for Changsha, respectively. However, Singapore respondents were more sensitive to PET change than Changsha respondents and the acceptable PET range for Changsha respondents was wider than that for Singapore respondents. Besides, the two city respondents had different thermal expectations with the preferred PET of 25.2 °C and 22.1 °C for Singapore and Changsha, respectively. The results also reveal that Changsha respondents were more tolerant than Singapore respondents under hot conditions. Finally, two regression models were proposed for Singapore and Changsha to predict the human thermal sensation in a given outdoor thermal environment.},

@article{Chow2016,
abstract = {Urban greenery is a favoured approach applied towards reducing urban warmth and climate discomfort, but ascertaining its measured and perceived effectiveness in tropical climates is relatively understudied. To this end, we investigated microclimate differences within an urban park (the Singapore Botanic Gardens) to assess if variations in plot-scale land cover affect both objective (measured) and subjective (surveyed) microclimate data. Over two monsoonal seasons, we obtained data from four distinct sites-a tropical rainforest stand, a palm tree valley, a water-body feature, and the park visitors' centre. Measured climate data (e.g. air temperature, vapour pressure, wind velocity and globe temperatures) were used to derive mean radiant temperature Tmrt and three thermal comfort indices (e.g. temperature-humidity index THI, physiological equivalent temperature PET, and wet-bulb globe temperature WBGT). Concurrent to these measurements, we also surveyed park users (n = 1573) for perceived microclimate sensations and preferences in thermal, humidity, wind and sun exposure, as well as their overall assessment of climate comfort/discomfort. The results indicate significant differences in both measured and perceived microclimates over different sites and seasons, with (i) selected heat stress thresholds based on thermal comfort indices exceeded at several sites, and (ii) visitors perceived generally hot, humid and low-wind conditions throughout. Variations in respondent acclimatisation to tropical climates are observed between correlations of WBGT and some sensation votes, with apparently stronger correlations with more acclimated respondents. While humidity was voted as the most uncomfortable climate variable across all sites, a large majority of respondents felt comfortable climate conditions throughout. Present results confirm that vegetation canopy characteristics affecting wind and sun exposure appear to be important factors in outdoor thermal comfort. Lastly, we suggest that future tropical outdoor thermal comfort studies consider the critical aspects of site humidity and wind to discern comfort/discomfort levels.},

@article{ScottKrayenhoff2016,
abstract = {Surface temperature is a key variable in boundary-layer meteorology and is typically acquired by remote observation of emitted thermal radiation. However, the three-dimensional structure of cities complicates matters: uneven solar heating of urban facets produces an " effective anisotropy " of surface thermal emission at the neighbourhood scale. Remotely-sensed urban surface temperature varies with sensor view angle as a consequence. The authors combine a microscale urban surface temperature model with a thermal remote sensing model to predict the effective anisotropy of simplified neighbourhood configurations. The former model provides detailed surface temperature distributions for a range of " urban " forms, and the remote sensing model computes aggregate temperatures for multiple view angles. The combined model's ability to reproduce observed anisotropy is evaluated against measurements from a neighbourhood in Vancouver, Canada. As in previous modeling studies, anisotropy is underestimated. Addition of moderate coverages of small (sub-facet scale) structure can account for much of the missing anisotropy. Subsequently, over 1900 sensitivity simulations are performed with the model combination, and the dependence of daytime effective thermal anisotropy on diurnal solar path (i.e., latitude and time of day) and blunt neighbourhood form is assessed. The range of effective anisotropy, as well as the maximum difference from nadir-observed brightness temperature, peak for moderate building-height-to-spacing ratios (H/W), and scale with canyon (between-building) area; dispersed high-rise urban forms generate maximum anisotropy. Maximum anisotropy increases with solar elevation and scales with shortwave irradiance. Moreover, it depends linearly on H/W for H/W {\textless} 1.25, with a slope that depends on maximum off-nadir sensor angle. Decreasing minimum brightness temperature is primarily responsible for this linear growth of maximum anisotropy. These results allow first order estimation of the minimum effective anisotropy magnitude of urban neighbourhoods as a function of building-height-to-spacing ratio, building plan area density, and shortwave irradiance. Finally, four " local climate zones " are simulated at two latitudes. Removal of neighbourhood street orientation regularity for these zones decreases maximum anisotropy by 3{\%}–31{\%}. Furthermore, thermal and radiative material properties are a weaker predictor of anisotropy than neighbourhood morphology. This study is the first systematic evaluation of effective anisotropy magnitude and causation for urban landscapes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Few studies have focused on the effect of countdown timers at signalized intersections in China, where such timers are widely deployed for their perceived benefits of increased safety and capacity. This study examines the effect of countdown timers on driver behavior during the yellow interval. METHOD: Signal phasing and traffic operations were videotaped at 4 comparable signalized intersections under normal conditions. Microscopic details were extracted manually at 25 Hz to yield 24 h of data on onset time of the yellow, onset time of the red, driver location and actions after the onset of the yellow, red light-running violations, etc. For comparable intersections with and without countdown timers, driver behavior measured by driver decision (stop or go) and vehicle entry time (when the vehicle crosses the stop line) were analyzed using binary logistical regression (BLR) and a nonparametric test, respectively. RESULTS: The results suggest that countdown timers can indeed influence driver behaviors, in terms of decisions to stop or cross the intersection as well as the distribution of vehicle entry times. There was a strong correlation between the presence of countdown timers and an increase in red light violations. CONCLUSION: Countdown timers may lead to increased entrance into the intersection during the later portions of the yellow and even the red. This alarming finding calls for further research as well as for serious consideration before the field deployment of countdown timers.},

@article{DeDear2004,
abstract = {Since the early twentieth century when air-conditioning began penetrating the market in a serious way, there has been a need for human factors research upon which HVAC engineering practice could be based. Now we have nearly a century of thermal comfort research from climate chambers and much has been learnt in that time. By stripping the research problem back to essential cause-and-effect variables, climate chamber methods have delivered results that are amenable to rigorous data analyses leading to unequivocal conclusions. However, in the minds of HVAC practitioners there are persistent doubts about the experiential realism of the chamber methodology, and the external validity of their findings, in particular, their relevance to building occupants going about their normal daily routines in fully-engineered indoor climatic environments. In response to this methodological concern in the 1990s, ASHRAE commissioned a series of thermal comfort studies aimed at field validating the findings of climate chamber research and the HVAC standards based upon them in a variety of climatic contexts around the world. This paper discusses the methodological benefits and constraints of conventional climate chamber research in comparison to the field-based alternative. In particular, issues such as sample size and demographics, research design, instrumentation and indoor climatic measurement procedures, questionnaires, clothing insulation and metabolic rate assessment techniques are analyzed. The discussion of methodology is then extended to the discipline of environmental psychology, which should have made a much more significant contribution to the topic of thermal comfort, and yet has remained relatively silent. The paper finishes by considering why engineers, most notably P.O. Fanger, have come to dominate a research topic that falls so clearly within the scope of psychology. HVAC engineering is the profession most directly occupied in the practice of thermal comfort, and therefore an engineer such as Fanger has been ideally qualified to design and conduct research, and even more important, presents its results in a way most directly useful to thermal comfort practitioners. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The paper gives practical advice on evaluating and designing for thermal comfort.},

To realize a Human-Probe environment, our research group has examined the usefulness of pressure sensors embedded in shoes [2]. In this demonstration, we present our recent work that extends our previous research on embedded pressure sensors by considering complimentary uses of accelerometers so as to measure walkability in our everyday spaces. Pressure sensors and accelerometers are similarly useful for capturing the motion of pedestrians; however, the close examination of the signals from both sensors reveals the strengths and the weaknesses of each, and suggests the possibility of their complimentary use to support Human Probes.},

@article{Drucker1999,
abstract = {Throughout history, people had little need to manage their careers--they were born into their station in life or, in the recent past, they relied on their companies to chart their career paths. But times have drastically changed. Today, we must all learn to manage ourselves. What does that mean? According to Peter Drucker, it means we have to learn to develop ourselves. We have to place ourselves where we can make the greatest contribution to our organizations and communities. And we have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work that we do. It may seem obvious that people achieve results by doing what they are good at and by working in ways that fit their abilities. But, Drucker says, very few people actually know--let alone take advantage of--their unique strengths. He challenges each of us to ask ourselves fundamental questions: What are my strengths? How do I perform? What are my values? Where do I belong? What should my contribution be? Don't try to change yourself, cautions Drucker. Instead, concentrate on improving the skills you have and accepting assignments that are tailored to your individual way of working. If you do that, you can transform yourself from an ordinary worker into an outstanding performer. Successful careers today are not planned out in advance. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they have asked themselves those questions, and they have rigorously assessed their unique characteristics. This article challenges readers to take responsibility for managing their futures, both in and out of the office.},

abstract = {Studies have repeatedly affirmed the positive links between human and environmental health but few have sufficiently addressed the complexity brought about by the range of urbanity, population and both green space and domestic gardens cover associated human settlements. With the global population increasingly residing in cities, the relevance of urbanisation, local population and discrete types of green space provision on measures of health, remains a research imperative. To explore this complexity, a series of regression models were employed to quantify the mitigation of local health deprivation by green space and domestic gardens, across a four-stage rural-urban gradient, controlling for household income and local population. The population-standardised quantification of green space provision offered greater interpretive power than did a simple measure of land cover density. Domestic gardens, of the two green land-cover types, provided the most convincing mitigating effect on health deprivation. The findings call for increased acknowledgement of urban gardens in local health promotion, and a closer consideration of local population in planning green space provision and management.},

abstract = {The performance of different urban surface parameterizations in the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) in simulating urban boundary layer (UBL) was investigated using extensive measurements during the Texas Air Quality Study 2006 field campaign. The extensive field measurements collected on surface (meteorological, wind profiler, energy balance flux) sites, a research aircraft, and a research vessel characterized 3-dimensional atmospheric boundary layer structures over the Houston-Galveston Bay area, providing a unique opportunity for the evaluation of the physical parameterizations. The model simulations were performed over the Houston metropolitan area for a summertime period (12-17 August) using a bulk urban parameterization in the$\backslash$nNoah land surface model (original LSM), a modified LSM, and a single-layer$\backslash$nurban canopy model (UCM). The UCM simulation compared quite well$\backslash$nwith the observations over the Houston urban areas, reducing the$\backslash$nsystematic model biases in the original LSM simulation by 1-2 degrees$\backslash$nC in near-surface air temperature and by 200-400 m in UBL height,$\backslash$non average. A more realistic turbulent (sensible and latent heat)$\backslash$nenergy partitioning contributed to the improvements in the UCM simulation.$\backslash$nThe original LSM significantly overestimated the sensible heat flux$\backslash$n(similar to 200 W m(-2)) over the urban areas, resulting in warmer$\backslash$nand higher UBL. The modified LSM slightly reduced warm and high biases$\backslash$nin near-surface air temperature (0.5-1 degrees C) and UBL height$\backslash$n(similar to 100 m) as a result of the effects of urban vegetation.$\backslash$nThe relatively strong thermal contrast between the Houston area and$\backslash$nthe water bodies (Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico) in the LSM$\backslash$nsimulations enhanced the sea/bay breezes, but the model performance$\backslash$nin predicting local wind fields was similar among the simulations$\backslash$nin terms of statistical evaluations. These results suggest that a$\backslash$nproper surface representation (e.g. urban vegetation, surface morphology)$\backslash$nand explicit parameterizations of urban physical processes are required$\backslash$nfor accurate urban atmospheric numerical modeling.},

abstract = {Capture and geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO(2) ) has been suggested to be essential to reduce emissions to the atmosphere and aid mitigation of global climate change. However, leakage from transport pipelines or carbon capture and storage (CCS) reservoirs may pose risks to vegetation and contribute to rising atmospheric concentrations [CO(2) ]. This study examined effects on seedling emergence and growth when field bean plants (Vicia faba cv. Wizard) grown under field conditions were subjected to elevated soil [CO(2) ] for 39 days after planting. The strong negative correlation between soil [CO(2) ] and [O(2) ] during the injection period created a hypoxic soil environment under conditions of elevated soil [CO(2) ]. The damaging impact of this treatment became apparent early in the experiment as no seeds exposed to soil [CO(2) ] {\textgreater}50{\%} emerged, even after injection was discontinued. Some seeds exposed to soil [CO(2) ] {\textless}50{\%} produced seedlings, but many did not survive. Seedling emergence and survival in the gassed plots was greatest at [CO(2) ] of 5-20{\%}, but root and shoot growth was reduced relative to control plants. Seedling emergence and growth were negatively related to soil [CO(2) ] and positively related to [O(2) ], although it is not known which was more important in inducing the observed effects. These findings suggest that leakage of CO(2) from transport pipelines or CCS sites may greatly reduce seedling emergence and crop establishment in the vicinity of such infrastructures.},

abstract = {Pedestrian wind environment is one of the urban physical environments that have a significant impact on the overall wellbeing of a city and its dwellers. It is important to be able to assess pedestrian wind environment in the urban planning design stage. Such assessment is intrinsically an in-design assessment and should be based on spatial analysis. The methodology developed considers the probabilistic nature of the assessment by determining an 80-percentile ambient wind speed as the boundary condition for wind environment simulation. The assessing criteria include mechanical comfort, safety, and amplification factor. Their threshold values are based on comparisons of existing criteria. In addition, the concept of tolerance factor, which takes into account the psychological effects of different urban spaces on people, is integrated into the assessment system. The assessment methodology can be used by urban planners in parallel with the process of designing urban physical spaces. A case study of the downtown area of an urban planning project near Lake Tai in China is conducted to demonstrate the application of the assessment methodology. Two limitations of the methodology need to be noted. First, it relies on CFD techniques to obtain the wind environment and therefore, the simulation must be conducted with considerable care and circumspection. Secondly, the methodology does not include the thermal and ventilation effects of pedestrian wind.},

@article{Blazejczyk2012,
abstract = {Over the past century more than 100 indices have been developed and used to assess bioclimatic conditions for human beings. The majority of these indices are used sporadically or for specific purposes. Some are based on generalized results of measurements (wind chill, cooling power, wet bulb temperature) and some on the empirically observed reactions of the human body to thermal stress (physiological strain, effective temperature). Those indices that are based on human heat balance considerations are referred to as "rational indices". Several simple human heat balance models are known and are used in research and practice. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), and some of the more prevalent thermal indices. The analysis is based on three groups of data: global data-set, synoptic datasets from Europe, and local scale data from special measurement campaigns of COST Action 730. We found the present indices to express bioclimatic conditions reasonably only under specific meteorological situations, while the UTCI represents specific climates, weather, and locations much better. Furthermore, similar to the human body, the UTCI is very sensitive to changes in ambient stimuli: temperature, solar radiation, wind and humidity. UTCI depicts temporal variability of thermal conditions better than other indices. The UTCI scale is able to express even slight differences in the intensity of meteorological stimuli.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the effects of trees on the local urban microclimate and human thermal comfort under different local weather conditions, in a small urban area in Assen, the Netherlands. In both summer and winter, continuous air temperature and relative humidity measurements were conducted at five selected sites having obviously different environmental characteristics in tree cover. Measurements demonstrated that in summer the microclimatic conditions at each observation site showed significant differences. The cooling effects of trees on clear and hot days were two times higher than on cloudy and cold days. In winter, air temperature was slightly reduced by the evergreen trees, and weather conditions did not cause a notable change on performance of trees on the microclimate. ENVI-met, a three- dimensional microclimate model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of temperature and humidity. After selecting representative days, we simulated the study site as it currently is and for a situation without trees. Spatial differences of trees' effects were found to vary strongly with weather conditions. Furthermore, human thermal comfort is indicated by the Predicted Mean Vote model. During the hottest hours, trees improved the thermal comfort level via reducing ‘very hot' and ‘hot' thermal perception by about 16 {\%} on clear days and 11{\%}on cloudy days. Generally, our findings demonstrate that urban microclimate and human thermal comfort convincingly varies in close geographical proximity. Both are strongly affected by the presence of local trees.Weather conditions play an important role on the trees' performance on the summer-time microclimate.},

abstract = {Promoting walking for health among older adults in Korea has received growing attention, but limited research on the association of environmental factors with walking has been conducted. This study examined the association of personal, social, and environmental variables with leisure-time walking in older Korean adults. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the integration of environmental variables into a model based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample (N = 335) of older Korean adults measured perceived environmental variables, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (PBC), intention, and walking. Data were analyzed using a two-step approach: a measurement model was fit to the data; then structural models (TPB-only and TPB plus environmental variables) were tested and compared. SEM revealed that neighborhood quality and safety had significant positive relationships with the TPB variables and indirectly influenced intention and walking. Personal and social factors mediated the relationship between neighborhood environment and walking, and PBC was important in directly and indirectly influencing walking. The extended TPB model explained 65.0{\%} of the variance in intention, and 45.0{\%} of the variance in walking. The inclusion of neighborhood variables in the TPB model resulted in an additional 0.6{\%} increase in the variance explained in walking habits. These findings suggest that perceived environmental variables might help explain older adults' walking and that the TPB model with the environmental variables provides a useful framework to predict walking in older Korean adults.},

abstract = {With federal policy beginning to shift from autocentric planning, provision for pedestrian and bicycle access is now mandated in federally supported projects. However, the field of transportation planning has little in the way of theory and methods to guide design and planning for walkable cities. Walkability is increasingly valued for a variety of reasons. Not only does pedestrian transportation reduce congestion and have low environmental impact, it has social and recreational value. Recent research suggests that walking also promotes mental and physical health. The quality of the pedestrian environment is key to encouraging people to choose walking over driving. Six criteria are presented for design of a successful pedestrian network: ͑1͒ connectivity; ͑2͒ linkage with other modes; ͑3͒ fine grained land use patterns; ͑4͒ safety; ͑5͒ quality of path; and ͑6͒ path context. To achieve walkable cities in the United States it will be necessary to assess current walkability conditions, revise standards and regulations, research walking behavior in varied settings, promote public education and participation in pedestrian planning, and encourage collaboration and interdisciplinary education between transportation engineers and the design professions.},

abstract = {The widespread use of solar-reflective roofing materials can save energy, mitigate urban heat islands and slow global warming by cooling the roughly 20{\%} of the urban surface that is roofed. In this study we created prototype solar-reflective nonwhite concrete tile and asphalt shingle roofing materials using a two-layer spray coating process intended to maximize both solar reflectance and factory-line throughput. Each layer is a thin, quick-drying, pigmented latex paint based on either acrylic or a poly(vinylidene fluoride)/acrylic blend. The first layer is a titanium dioxide rutile white basecoat that increases the solar reflectance of a gray-cement concrete tile from 0.18 to 0.79, and that of a shingle surfaced with bare granules from 0.06 to 0.62. The second layer is a "cool" color topcoat with weak near-infrared (NIR) absorption and/or strong NIR backscattering. Each layer dries within seconds, potentially allowing a factory line to pass first under the white spray, then under the color spray. We combined a white basecoat with monocolor topcoats in various shades of red, brown, green and blue to prepare 24 cool colored prototype tiles and 24 cool colored prototypes shingles. The solar reflectances of the tiles ranged from 0.26 (dark brown; CIELAB lightness value L*=29) to 0.57 (light green; L*=76); those of the shingles ranged from 0.18 (dark brown; L*=26) to 0.34 (light green; L*=68). Over half of the tiles had a solar reflectance of at least 0.40, and over half of the shingles had a solar reflectance of at least 0.25. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@techreport{DptDesign2010,
abstract = {Obesity and with it type 2 diabetes are now epidemic in New York City, and both problems are growing worse rapidly. The rise in obesity is tied to the population's over-consumption of calories and under-expenditure of human energy, both of which are shaped by the built environments in which we live, work, and play. Today, architectural and urban design too often support unhealthy rather than healthy diets, and sedentary rather than active daily lifestyles. The Active Design Guidelines aim to reverse these trends, by providing architects and urban designers in New York City and beyond with a manual for creating healthier buildings, streets, and urban spaces. Active design is environmental design that encourages stair climbing, walking, bicycling, transit use, active recreation, and healthy eating. Based on the latest academic research as well as best practices and cost-effective solutions developed in the field, the Active Design Guidelines suggest cost-effective ways to contribute toward the vision of a more livable and hospitable New York City promoted in Mayor Bloomberg's Design + Construction Excellence Initiative.},

abstract = {Canopy microclimate is a critical component of most biophysical processes in plants. Understanding the role of microclimate across scales in canopies with complex, heterogeneous architectures is challenging, as it is difficult to represent the relevant range of scales. In this study, a model was developed and validated to accurately predict the three-dimensional distribution of microclimate-related quantities (e.g., net radiation, surface temperature, evapotranspiration, flux partitioning) in complex canopy geometries. The modeling strategy was to aggregate individual leaves into isothermal sub-volumes, as resolving all leaves over whole-canopy scales is unfeasible. The model takes leaf-level models for convection, evapotranspiration, and radiative absorption/emission and integrates them over a discrete volume using the leaf angle probability distribution function. The model is built on a framework designed to utilize graphics processing units (GPUs) in order to offset the expense associated with model complexity, which can allow for the simulation of canopy-scale problems at sub-tree resolution. Additional cost-saving strategies are also suggested. Three-dimensional canopy energy transfer models have traditionally been difficult to validate. Two validation experiments were designed to simultaneously measure virtually all model outputs, often using multiple methods at many spatial locations. The model was able to reproduce point, 3D distributed, and bulk measurements at high accuracy, with average model errors within expected measurement errors.},

abstract = {We explored Google Street View (GSV) as a street-level, urban greenery assessment tool. Street-level greenery has long played a critical role in the visual quality of urban landscapes. This living landscape element can and should be assessed for the quality of visual impact with the GSV information, and the assessed street-level greenery information could be incorporated into urban landscape planning and management. Information on street-level views of urban greenery assessment, however, is rare or nonexistent. Planners and managers' ability to plan and manage urban landscapes effectively and efficiently is, therefore, limited. GSV is one tool that might provide street-level, profile views of urban landscape and greenery, yet no research on GSV for urban planning seems available in literature. We modified an existing Green View Index (GVI) formula and conducted a case study assessment of street greenery using GSV images in the area of East Village, Manhattan District, New York City. We found that GSV to be well suited for assessing street-level greenery. We suggest further that the modified GVI may be a relatively objective measurement of street-level greenery, and that GSV in combination with GVI may be well suited in guiding urban landscape planning and management.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to shed light on: (1) how greenspace and physical activity, independent of any synergy, are heterogeneously linked across the distribution of wellbeing; and also (2) how the potential synergies between greenspace and physical activity might have heterogeneous impacts across the distribution of wellbeing. Using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey and data from Geographic Information Systems this study finds, for the case of major Australian cities, that greenspace and physical activity are independently positively associated with life satisfaction, mental health and negatively associated with psychological distress. A finding which is stronger for physical activity than it is for greenspace. Across measures of life satisfaction, mental health and psychological distress, the results lend support to the hypothesis that physical activity may be relatively more effective at mitigating the likelihood of experiencing a serious dearth of wellbeing, compared to promoting higher levels of wellbeing. Unexpectedly, the results do not provide support for the hypothesised greenspace-physical activity synergy. A result found to be common across the wellbeing distribution. While further research is required to draw a definitive conclusion, this result may indicate that physical activity is simply not conducive to the realisation of the restorative benefits of exposure to nature, and the other co-benefits of ???green exercise???. In all, the findings presented in this study add to the existing stock of knowledge from a socialecological perspective and also raise new questions for future research. The results presented in this study may also prove useful to policy makers wrestling with the challenges of maintaining or improving residents' wellbeing and reducing residents' ill-being in the face of continuing population growth and declining per capita greenspace.},

abstract = {This manuscript presents a study aimed at characterizing the seasonal course of photosynthetic capacity of an alpine deciduous conifer, European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), based on chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and photosynthetic pigment analysis. The study focused on the characterization of autumn senescence events which (contrary to bud-burst) are still scarcely investigated. The study was conducted on two natural European larch stands in the northwestern Italian Alps during two consecutive years. The results show that photosynthetic efficiency as assessed by fluorescence measurements was controlled by variations in air and soil temperature. Photosynthesis responded to variations in maximum air and soil temperature in a delayed way, with a varying lag depending on the seasonal period considered. The analysis of photosynthetic efficiency and pigment decline at the end of the growing season identified two senescence phases. During early senescence, plants manifested only the beginning of needle decolouration, while during late senescence pigment degradation led to a loss in photosynthetic efficiency. This behavior indicates that the beginning of needle yellowing and the decline in photosynthetic efficiency can occur at different times-a finding that should be considered in order to improve models of ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Drawing from three phases of a social research programme between 2002 and 2008, this paper proposes a framework for underpinning the development of urban water transitions policy and city-scale benchmarking at the macro scale. Through detailed historical, contemporary and futures research involving Australian cities, a transitions framework is proposed, presenting a typology of six city states, namely the 'Water Supply City', the 'Sewered City', the 'Drained City', the 'Waterways City', the 'Water Cycle City', and the 'Water Sensitive City'. This framework recognises the temporal, ideological and technological contexts that cities transition through when moving towards sustainable urban water conditions. The aim of this research is to assist urban water managers with understanding the scope of the hydro-social contracts currently operating across cities in order to determine the capacity development and cultural reform initiatives needed to effectively expedite the transition to more sustainable water management and ultimately to Water Sensitive Cities. One of the values of this framework is that it can be used by strategists and policy makers as a heuristic device and/or the basis for a future city state benchmarking tool. From a research perspective it can be an underpinning framework for future work on transitions policy research.},

abstract = {SURFEX is a new externalized land and ocean sur-face platform that describes the surface fluxes and the evo-lution of four types of surfaces: nature, town, inland water and ocean. It is mostly based on pre-existing, well-validated scientific models that are continuously improved. The moti-vation for the building of SURFEX is to use strictly identi-cal scientific models in a high range of applications in order to mutualise the research and development efforts. SURFEX can be run in offline mode (0-D or 2-D runs) or in coupled mode (from mesoscale models to numerical weather predic-tion and climate models). An assimilation mode is included for numerical weather prediction and monitoring. In addition to momentum, heat and water fluxes, SURFEX is able to sim-ulate fluxes of carbon dioxide, chemical species, continental aerosols, sea salt and snow particles. The main principles of the organisation of the surface are described first. Then, a survey is made of the scientific module (including the cou-pling strategy). Finally, the main applications of the code are summarised. The validation work undertaken shows that re-placing the pre-existing surface models by SURFEX in these applications is usually associated with improved skill, as the numerous scientific developments contained in this commu-nity code are used to good advantage.},

abstract = {Mitigation of the urban heat island (UHI) effect at the city-scale is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in conjunction with the Princeton Urban Canopy Model (PUCM). Specifically, the cooling impacts of green roof and cool (white/highalbedo) roof strategies over the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area during a heat wave period (7 June–10 June 2008) are assessed using the optimal set-up of WRF-PUCM described in the companion paper by Li and Bou-Zeid (2014). Results indicate that the surface UHI effect (defined based on the urban–rural surface temperature difference) is reduced significantly more than the near-surface UHI effect (defined based on urban–rural 2 m air temperature difference) when these mitigation strategies are adopted. In addition, as the green and cool roof fractions increase, the surface and near-surface UHIs are reduced almost linearly. Green roofs with relatively abundant soil moisture have comparable effect in reducing the surface and near-surface UHIs to cool roofs with an albedo value of 0.7. Significant indirect effects are also observed for both green and cool roof strategies; mainly, the low-level advection of atmospheric moisture from rural areas into urban terrain is enhanced when the fraction of these roofs increases, thus increasing the humidity in urban areas. The additional benefits or penalties associated with modifications of the main physical determinants of green or cool roof performance are also investigated. For green roofs, when the soil moisture is increased by irrigation, additional cooling effect is obtained, especially when the ‘unmanaged' soil moisture is low. The effects of changing the albedo of cool roofs are also substantial. These results also underline the capabilities of the WRF-PUCM framework to support detailed analysis and diagnosis of the UHI phenomenon, and of its different mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {Objective: Pedestrians are among the most vulnerable road users in terms of their risk of serious injury when involved in a collision with a vehicle. In Australia, around 200 pedestrians are killed in road crashes annually and over 2,000 are seriously injured. The objective of the current study was to analyze pedestrian death and injury risk by body region across 10 light passenger and commercial vehicle market groups in Victoria, Australia. Methods: This study utilized police-reported crash data linked to insurance injury compensation claims data during the period 2001–2010 to determine whether pedestrian injury outcome is a function of colliding vehicle type. Logistic regression models were developed to measure the risk of pedestrian death or injury as a function of vehicle market group for 4 body region groupings, namely, all body regions; the head, face, or neck; the thorax; and the lower extremities (including pelvis). Results: Analysis focused on head, face, or neck injury found that pedestrians struck by small cars, people movers, large sport utility vehicles (SUVs), vans, or utility vehicles had statistically significantly higher odds of death or injury compared to large cars. When the analysis focused on thoracic injury, it was again found that pedestrians struck by large SUVs and vans had statistically significantly higher odds of death injury compared to large cars. In particular, the odds of death or thoracic injury is 74.4{\%} higher for large SUVs compared to large cars. Analysis focused on lower extremity injury found no market group with statistically significant different odds of death or injury compared to large cars at the 5{\%} level; however, medium cars and vans were found to have statistically significantly lower odds of death or lower extremity injury at the 10{\%} level. Conclusions: The results suggest that the increasing popularity of vehicles such as SUVs has the potential to lead to an increase in the level of pedestrian road trauma. With the general trend toward the use of larger vehicles, the results provide validation of the importance of improved vehicle design and the incorporation of new pedestrian safety features. {\textcopyright} 2015, Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Background: The physical attributes of residential neighborhoods, particularly the connectedness of streets and the proximity of destinations, can influence walking behaviors. To provide the evidence for public health advocacy on activity-friendly environments, large-scale studies in different countries are needed. Associations of neighborhood physical environments with adults' walking for transport and walking for recreation must be better understood. Method: Walking for transport and walking for recreation were assessed with a validated survey among 2650 adults recruited from neighborhoods in an Australian city between July 2003 and June 2004, with neighborhoods selected to have either high or low walkability, based on objective measures of connectedness and proximity derived from geographic information systems (GIS) databases. The study design was stratified by area-level socioeconomic status, while analyses controlled for participant age, gender, individual-level socioeconomic status, and reasons for neighborhood self-selection. Results: A strong independent positive association was found between weekly frequency of walking for transport and the objectively derived neighborhood walkability index. Preference for walkable neighborhoods moderated the relationship of walkability with weekly minutes, but not the frequency of walking for transport-walkability was related to higher frequency of transport walking, irrespective of neighborhood self-selection. There were no significant associations between environmental factors and walking for recreation. Conclusions: Associations of neighborhood walkability attributes with walking for transport were confirmed in Australia. They accounted for a modest but statistically significant proportion of the total variation of the relevant walking behavior. The physical environment attributes that make up the walkability index are potentially important candidate factors for future environmental and policy initiatives designed to increase physical activity. ?? 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

This study was aimed at exploring perceived restorativeness of private gardens and its predictors. In an online survey, 856 respondents rated the perceived restorativeness of private gardens, attached outdoor green spaces and living rooms with green elements. Characteristics of the garden, sociodemographic data, personal characteristics, and the relationship between user and garden were surveyed. Results indicated that the private garden scored highest on perceived restorativeness. A multiple regression analysis explained 52.2{\%} of the variance of the perceived restorativeness of private gardens. The garden-user relationship qualified as the strongest predictor of the restorative potential. We suggest considering the significance of affective bonds in designing restorative private gardens.},

@article{Fernandez1997,
abstract = {Little is known about the strategies used by olive trees to overcome the long dry periods typical of the areas where they are cropped. This makes it difficult to optimize the water supply in orchards. To study the control of water consumption by olive trees, measurements of leaf water potential (PSI) and stomatal conductance to H-2O (g) were made on 26-year-old Manzanillo olive trees under three irrigation treatments. The first treatment provided enough water to cover the crop water demand, the next treatment supplied one third of that rate, and the final treatment was no irrigation at all, typical of dry-farming conditions. Under conditions of high vapour pressure deficit of the air (D-alpha), the olive trees prevented excessive water loss by closing their stomata. Leaves of the current year showed better stomatal control than did the 1-year-old leaves. The upper-bound functional relationships between g and D-alpha and photon flux density (I-P) were obtained by boundary-line analysis, based on a technique of non-linear least squares. Maximum values of g were observed at relatively low levels of I-P, from about 500 mu-mol m-2 s-1, and a proportional decrease in g with increasing D-alpha was also found, at least for values of up to approximately 3.5 kPa. Higher values of g were observed in the morning than in the afternoon, for similar levels of I-P and D-alpha. Unirrigated olive trees recovered quickly after the dry season, showing values of PSI and g similar to those of irrigated trees after just two days.},

@article{DeMunck2013,
abstract = {The need to prepare cities for climate change adaptation requests the urban modeller community to implement sustainable adaptation strategies within their models to be tested against specific city morphologies and scenarios. Greening city roofs is part of these strategies. In this context, the GREENROOF module for TEB (town energy balance) has been developed to model the interactions between buildings and green roof systems at the scale of the city. This module, which combines the ISBA model (Interaction between Soil Biosphere and Atmosphere) and TEB, allows for one to describe an extensive green roof composed of four functional layers (vegetation-grasses or sedums; substrate; retention/drainage layers; and artificial roof layers) and to model vegetation-atmosphere fluxes of heat, water and momentum, as well as the hydrological fluxes throughout the substrate and the drainage layers, and the thermal fluxes throughout the natural and artificial layers of the green roof. TEB-GREENROOF (SURFEX v7.3) should therefore be able to represent the impact of climate forcings on the functioning of green roof vegetation and, conversely, the influence of the green roof on the local climate. An evaluation of GREENROOF is performed for a case study located in Nancy (France) which consists of an instrumented extensive green roof with sedums and substrate and drainage layers that are typical of this kind of construction. After calibration of the drainage layer hydrological characteristics, model results show good dynamics for the substrate water content and the drainage at the green roof base, with nevertheless a tendency to underestimate the water content and overestimate the drainage. This does not impact too much the green roof temperatures, which present a good agreement with observations. Nonetheless GREENROOF tends to overestimate the soil temperatures and their amplitudes, but this effect is less important in the drainage layer. These results are encouraging with regard to modelling the impact of green roofs on thermal indoor comfort and energy consumption at the scale of cities, for which GREENROOF will be running with the building energy version of TEB-TEB-BEM. Moreover, with the green roof studied for GREENROOF evaluation being a type of extensive green roof widespread in cities, the type of hydrological characteristics highlighted for the case study will be used as the standard configuration to model extensive green roof impacts at the scale of cities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {After a successional forest is severely disturbed by wildﬁre and subsequent salvage logging or by clearfell timber harvesting and slash burning, if conditions are suitable, the forest will regenerate. It then passes through a series of stages of varying ﬂoristic composition and structure until further severe disturbance occurs. The characteristics of a forest- bird assemblage vary with both the successional stage of the forest (time period since the most recent severe disturbance event) and the long-term disturbance history of the forest. To determine how the bird assemblage changes during succession in a south-eastern Australian forest type that is ﬁre-sensitive and also subject to regular timber harvesting, we surveyed birds in ﬁve age-classes of wet forest (from 2 to {\textgreater}100 years post-disturbance). Bird-assemblage composition altered sequentially; the pattern and rate of change reﬂected those of the vegetation. Bird abundance and species richness varied little during succession. No species of bird was abundant only in early successional forest. Some species, such as Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla), Golden Whistler (Pachycephala pectoralis) and Grey Fantail (Rhipidura albiscapa), were common in all successional stages. Other species, such as White-throated Treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea) and Striated Pardalote (Pardalotus striatus), were consistently abundant in mid- to late successional stages only; this highlighted the importance of older forests for avian biodiversity. Any increase in the frequency of severe disturbance in these forests would tend to favour only those bird species that are already common. This has implications for management programs in forests that are habitat for wildlife, but are also used by humans for timber harvesting and other commercial or recreational purposes.},

abstract = {Cities are systems that include natural and human-created components. When a city grows without proper planning, it tends to have low environmental quality. If improving environmental quality is intended, people's opinion should be taken into account for a better acceptance of urban management decisions. In this study, we assessed people's perception of trees by conducting a survey with a controlled sample of citizens from the city of Morelia (west-central Mexico). Citizens liked both native and exotic tree species and rejected mainly exotic ones. Preference for trees were related to tree attributes; such as size. Trees that dropped leaves or tended to fall were not liked. The most- mentioned tree-related benefits were oxygen supply and shade; the most mentioned tree- related damages were accidents and infrastructure damage. The majority of respondents preferred trees near houses to increase tree density. Also, most respondents preferred trees in green areas as well as close to their houses, as they consider that trees provide oxygen. The majority of the respondents thought more trees were needed in the city. In general, our results show that although people perceive that trees in urban areas can cause damages, they often show more interest for the benefits related to trees and consider there should be more trees in cities. We strongly suggest the development of studies that broaden our knowledge of citizen preferences in relation to urban vegetation, and that further policy making takes their perception into account when considering creating new urban green areas, regardless of their type or size.

The results show that the atmospheric dynamics are sensitive to land surface conditions. The most sensitive parameters are dimensional parameters, i.e. roof width, aspect ratio, roughness length of heat and momentum, since these parameters control the magnitude of sensible heat flux. The relative insensitive parameters are hydrological parameters since the lawns or green roofs in urban areas are regularly irrigated so that the water availability for evaporation is never constrained.},

abstract = {Abstract:Walking has an important role in improving public health. In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature in public health, transportation, and urban design, which has analyzed the role of the built environment on physical activity, typically walking. Although these issues have received considerable attention in developed countries, few studies exist in developing countries such as Iran. The present study is the first study in the capital city of Iran: Tehran. This paper aims to analyze the objective measuring of the built envi- ronment in relation to walking in some neighborhoods of Tehran city. The results are then compared with the level of self-reported walking among elderly people in the study area. The results revealed that elderly people who live in high-walkable neighborhoods walk more fre- quently than those who live in low-walkable neighborhoods regardless of their socioeconomic status.},

abstract = {The Perceived Temperature (PT) is an equivalent temperature based on a complete heat budget model of the human body. It has proved its suitability for numerous applications across a wide variety of scales from micro to global and is successfully used both in daily forecasts and climatological studies. PT is designed for staying outdoors and is defined as the air temperature of a reference environment in which the thermal perception would be the same as in the actual environment. The calculation is performed for a reference subject with an internal heat production of 135 W m(-2) (who is walking at 4 km h(-1) on flat ground). In the reference environment, the mean radiant temperature equals the air temperature and wind velocity is reduced to a slight draught. The water vapour pressure remains unchanged. Under warm/humid conditions, however, it is implicitly related to a relative humidity of 50{\%}. Clothing is adapted in order to achieve thermal comfort. If this is impossible, cold or heat stress will occur, respectively. The assessment of thermal perception by means of PT is based on Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) together with additional model extensions taking account of stronger deviations from thermal neutrality. This is performed using a parameterisation based on a two-node model. In the cold, it allows the mean skin temperature to drop below the comfort value. In the heat, it assesses additionally the enthalpy of sweat-moistened skin and of wet clothes. PT has the advantages of being self-explanatory due to its deviation from air temperature and being-via PMV-directly linked to a thermo-physiologically-based scale of thermal perception that is widely used and has stood the test of time. This paper explains in detail the basic equations of the human heat budget and the coefficients of the parameterisations.},

abstract = {In recent years, a series of studies have highlighted the positive effects of urban green on individual activity behaviour and health. In this paper, we examine salutogenic environment effects of urban green upon walking behaviour and how such effects are mediated by built environment configuration and street-level physical accessibility. The dwelling locations of N=. 15,354 respondents of the London Travel Demand Survey were geocoded and individual walking behaviour was extracted from the travel diary. A 0.5-m resolution normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) index derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data was employed as an objective measure of greenness, while density of street trees acted as proxy of perceived environmental quality in street corridors. A network model of street-level physical accessibility was developed using spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA). Logistic regression models reported a significant association of odds of walking with density of street trees and street-level betweenness (a measure of street network connectivity), while sensitivity analyses with continuous regression models for participants doing some walking indicated beneficial associations of distance walked with NDVI greenness and street trees. The results illustrate the necessity for targeted intervention strategies in activity-friendly planning via greening and optimized physical design of urban built environments.},

abstract = {Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are highly useful molecular markers for plant improvement. Expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR markers have a higher rate of transferability across species than genomic SSR markers and are thus well suited for application in cross-species phylogenetic studies. Our objectives were to examine the amplification of tall fescue EST-SSR markers in 12 grass species representing 8 genera of 4 tribes from 2 subfamilies of Poaceae and the applicability of these markers for phylogenetic analysis of grass species. About 43{\%} of the 145 EST-SSR primer pairs produced PCR bands in all 12 grass species and had high levels of polymorphism in all forage grasses studied. Thus, these markers will be useful in a variety of forage grass species, including the ones tested in this study. SSR marker data were useful in grouping genotypes within each species. Lolium temulentum, a potential model species for cool-season forage grasses, showed a close relation with the major Festuca-Lolium species in the study. Tall wheat grass was found to be closely related to hexaploid wheat, thereby confirming the known taxonomic relations between these species. While clustering of closely related species was found, the effectiveness of such data in evaluating distantly related species needs further investigations. The phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences of selected SSR bands were in agreement with the phylogenetic relations based on length polymorphism of SSRs markers. Tall fescue EST-SSR markers depicted phylogenetic relations among a wide range of cool-season forage grass species and thus are an important resource for researchers working with such grass species.},

@article{Bailey2014,
abstract = {A new model for radiative transfer in participating media and its application to complex plant canopies is presented. The goal was to be able to efficiently solve complex canopy-scale radiative transfer problems while also representing sub-plant heterogeneity. In the model, individual leaf surfaces are not resolved, but rather vegetation is aggregated into isothermal volumes. Using the leaf angle distribution and leaf area density functions, the volumes realistically augment the radiation field through absorption and anisotropic scattering and re-emission. The volumes are grouped to form individual plants, and individual plants are grouped to form entire canopies. The model increases efficiency by performing ray tracing calculations on graphics processing units (GPUs) using the NVIDIA?? OptiX??? and CUDA??? frameworks, and through efficient algorithms for radiation reflection, scattering, and emission. This efficiency allows for realistic representation of heterogeneity, while also allowing for the solution of problems with very large domains ({\~{}}105 trees) quickly on an inexpensive desktop workstation. Problem execution time scaled nearly linearly with the number of discrete elements in the domain. Model results are compared with experimental data collected from an array of radiation sensors within and above a grapevine canopy and an isolated tree. Agreement between simulated and measured values of shortwave and longwave radiation were very good, with model predictions generally within the expected measurement accuracy.},

abstract = {The study of leaf anatomy and of the mechanisnls of the opening and closing of stomatal guard cells leads one to suppose that the stomata constitute the main or even the sole regulating system in leuf transpiration. G. G. J. BANCE, 1953 evapotranspiration is independent of the character of the plant cover, of soil type and of land utilization to the extent that it varies under normal conditions. C. W. THORNTHWAITE, in Wilm, 1944 It It is widely supposed by plant physiologists and ecologists that stomata play a dominant role in regulating the amount of water transpired by vegetation. Theoretical studies on diffusion through single pores (Brown and Escombe, 1900; Milthorpe and Penman, 1967; Parlange and Wag- goner, 1970) and a multitude of studies on single leaves in the leaf chamber and in the field support this view (e.g., Schulze et al., 1972; Burrows and Milthorpe, 1976). Yet the view is not universally accepted by mi- crometeorologists who tend to emphasise the large amount of energy needed to evaporate water and stress the control exerted by the supply of this energy. With this in mind, meteorologists have developed a wide variety of formulae for estimating evaporation from vegetation (e.g., Thornthwaite, 1948; Penman, 1948; Turc, 1954; Priestley and Taylor, 1972) that are based entirely on weather variables and take no account at all of the species composition or stornatal properties of the transpiring vegetation. These “potential evaporation” formulae are widely and, to a large degree, successfully used for estimating evaporation from vegeta- tion that is not water-stressed. Clearly we have a conflict here, and one that demands resolution, since, as we shall show, each group has drawn reasonable conclusions from its experiments. In this article we shall discuss why the conflict has arisen and how the two views can be reconciled. To do this in a systematic way we must ask most precisely the question, “To what extent do stomata control transpi- ration?” Our approach will be through the equivalent question, “What will be the total change in transpiration, dE, due to a small, autonomous change in stornatal conductance, dg,?” In a general way we know that transpiration depends on stornatal con- ductance (gs), net radiation receipt (R,), and upon air saturation deficit (D), temperature (T) and wind speed (u). We also know that saturation deficit and wind speed vary through leaf boundary layers, through cano- pies and through the atmosphere above the canopies, so that it matters where they are measured. However, if we can agree on a suitable refer- ence level for their measurement, a general statement of the dependence of transpiration on these variables can be written as1},

The crux of his argument is that in theory helmets should not protect all mechanisms of brain injury and, therefore, all epidemiological research showing they are beneficial in a variety of circumstances is invalid. This short communication identifies some of the questionable elements in Curnow's assertions.},

abstract = {Walking as the major transit access mode confers health benefits to the public while presenting planners with the challenge of overcoming walk-accessibility costs which deter mass-transit use. The literature indicates sidewalk quality, availability, and street network connectedness are crucial access factors in walking to transit stations. However, the literature has not yielded a pragmatic tool for planners to assess walk access to transit stations in these terms. This paper offers a sidewalk availability and quality index (SAQI) and a connectivity index (CI) which grant insight into the pedestrian-rider's ability to access mass transit through the built environment. The methods are presented through an analysis of the Orange Line bus rapid transit (BRT) in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles. The analysis of the Orange Line using the SAQI and CI method determines which stops are least accessible to riders and indicates access solutions by identifying the overriding problem along the axes of quantity, quality, and design. Regression analysis concludes that there is a significant positive relationship between sidewalk connectedness and the use of public transportation, indicating the indices are useful as measures of walk-access costs and predictors of ridership},

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have reported associations between increases in summer temperatures and risks of premature mortality. The quantitative implications of predicted future increases in summer temperature, however, have not been extensively characterized. We have quantified these effects for the four main cities in Catalonia, Spain (Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida, Girona). We first used case-crossover analysis to estimate the association between temperature and mortality for each of these cities for the period 1983 to 2006. These exposure-response (ER) functions were then combined with local measures of current and projected changes in population, mortality and temperature for the years 2025 and 2050. Predicted daily mean temperatures were based on the A1B greenhouse gas emission, "business-as-usual" scenario simulations derived from the ENSEMBLES project. Several different ER functions were examined and significant associations between temperature and mortality were observed for all four cities. For these four cities, the age-specific piecewise linear model predicts 520 (95{\%}CI 340, 720) additional annual deaths attributable to the change in temperature in 2025 relative to the average from the baseline period of 1960-1990. For 2050, the estimate increases to 1,610 deaths per year during the warm season. For Catalonia as a whole, the point estimates for those two years are 720 and 2,330 deaths per year, respectively, or about 2 and 3{\%} of the warm season. In comparing these predicted impacts with current causes of mortality, they clearly represent significant burdens to public health in Catalonia.},

abstract = {Trees play an important role in mitigating heat stress on hot summer days, mainly due to their ability to provide shade. However, an important issue is also the reduction of solar radiation caused by trees in winter, in particular at high latitudes. In this study, we examine the transmissivity of total and direct solar radiation through crowns of single street trees in Goteborg, Sweden. One coniferous and four deciduous trees of species common in northern European cities were selected for case study. Radiation measurements were conducted on nine clear days in 2011-2012 in foliated and leafless tree conditions using two sunshine pyranometers-one located in shade of a tree and the other one on the roof of an adjacent building. The measurements showed a significant reduction of total and direct shortwave radiation in the shade of the studied trees, both foliated and leafless. Average transmissivity of direct solar radiation through the foliated and defoliated tree crowns ranged from 1.3 to 5.3 {\%} and from 40.2 to 51.9 {\%}, respectively. The results confirm the potential of a single urban tree to reduce heat stress in urban environment. However, the relatively low transmissivity through defoliated trees should be considered while planning street trees in high latitude cities, where the solar access in winter is limited. The results were used for parameterisation of SOLWEIG model for a better estimation of the mean radiant temperature (T-mrt). Measured values of transmissivity of solar radiation through both foliated and leafless trees were found to improve the model performance.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the severe conditions between car-to-pedestrian near-miss situations using pedestrian time-to-vehicle (pedestrian TTV) which is the time when the pedestrian would reach the forward moving car line. Since the information available from the real-world accidents was limited, the authors focused on the near-miss situations captured by driving recorders installed in passenger cars. In their previous study, the authors found there were some similarities between accidents and near-miss incidents. It was made clear that the situations in pedestrians' accidents could be estimated from the near-miss incident data which included motion pictures capturing pedestrian behaviors. In their previous study, the vehicle time-to-collision (vehicle TTC) was investigated from the near-miss incident data. The authors analyzed data for 101 near-miss car-to-pedestrian incident events in which pedestrians were crossing the roads in front of a forward-moving car at an intersection or on a straight road. Using a video of near-miss car-to-pedestrian incidents captured by drive recorders and collected by the Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan (J-SAE) from 2005 to 2009, the pedestrian TTV was calculated. Based on the calculated pedestrian TTV, one of the severe conditions between car-to-pedestrian near-miss situations was evaluated for pedestrians who emerged from behind an obstruction such as a building, a parked vehicle and a moving vehicle. Focusing on the cases of the pedestrians who emerged from behind an obstruction, the averages of the vehicle TTC and pedestrian TTV were 1.31 and 1.05 seconds, respectively, and did not demonstrate a significant difference. Since the averages of the vehicle TTC and pedestrian TTV were similar, there would be a higher possibility of the contact between a car and pedestrian if the driver and pedestrian were not paying any attention. The authors propose that a moving speed of a pedestrian surrogate "dummy" should be determined considering the near-miss incident situations for the evaluation of a CDMBS for pedestrian detection. The authors also propose that the time-to-collision of the dummy to the tested car during the evaluation of the performance of the CDMBS for pedestrian detection should be determined considering the time such as the vehicle TTC in this study. Additionally or alternatively, the pedestrian TTV should be considered, in which the worst situation was assumed for a car that was moving toward a pedestrian without braking due to the car driver's inattentiveness and the pedestrian not slowing down their walking speed or stopping.},

abstract = {In isolated communities where potable water sources as well as energy grids are limited or nonexistent, treating brackish groundwater aquifers with small-scale desalination systems can be a viable alternative to existing water infrastructures. Given the unavailability of power in many such situations, renewable energy is an obvious solution to power such systems. However, renewable energy is an intermittent power supply and with regards to the performance of intermittently operated desalination systems, only very limited experience exists, both with regards to efficiency as well as water quality. In this paper, this lack of knowledge is addressed by evaluating a system operated with varying parameters (pressure and flow) with constant power as a step toward defining a safe operating window, and they provide a basis for interpreting future data obtained with a renewable energy source. Field trials were performed on a brackish (5300 mg/L TDS; 8290 microS/cm) bore in Central Australia with a photovoltaic-powered membrane filtration (PV-membrane) system. Four nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes (BW30, ESPA4, NF90, TFC-S) and a number of operation parameter combinations (transmembrane pressure, feed flow, TFC-S) and operating parameters transmembrane pressure and feed flow were investigated to find the best operating conditions for maximum drinking water production and minimum specific energy consumption (SEC). The ESPA4 membrane performed best for this brackish source, producing 250 L/h of excellent drinking water (257 mg/L TDS; 400 microS/ cm) at an SEC of 1.2 kWh/m3. The issue of brine disposal or reuse is also discussed and the article compares the salinity of the produced brine with livestock water. Since the feedwater is disinfected physically using ultrafiltration (UF), the brine is free from bacteria and most viruses and hence can be seen more as a reusable product stream than a waste stream with a disposal problem.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the absence of suitable data that describes the urban landscape in climate relevant terms for climatic models is a significant impediment to progress, even if the physics that underpins these models is universal. To address this data gap the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project focuses on creating a global database on cities suited for urban climate studies. The first phase of WUDAPT has established a protocol using the Local Climate Zones classification system to partition the urban landscape of cities into neighbourhood types that can inform parameter selection in model applications. In this paper, we explore the potential of these data for use in the application of the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model, which incorporates Building Effect Parameterization and Building Energy Model (BEP-BEM) schemes. The test is conducted for Madrid (Spain) during winter and summer and the results of using LCZ derived data are compared with those using CORINE land-cover data. The results are indicative but show that the LCZ scheme improves model performance. The paper emphasizes the need for further work to extend the value of these models for decisions on urban planning. However, such work will need useful urban data to make progress.},

abstract = {As summer air temperatures continue to increase, urban areas will be most affected since urban building structures and materials intensify the heat island effect. The number of people who will be affected by increasing temperatures will rise, especially those in the heat-sensitive group of elderly people. Urban planning departments have to develop adaptation strategies in order to limit negative effects of climate change on their citizens. Due to their climatic ecosystem services, urban green areas can play an important role in this process. Since the effects of climate change can vary in different urban areas, a study was conducted focusing on identification of residential areas most affected by climate change according to surface cover structure and demographic characteristics in the City of Linz, Austria by using satellite images and demographic data. Residential areas with low vegetation cover and a high number of risk group members are identified as "climate-change sensitive residential areas (CCSRA)." About half of the residential areas of Linz and nearly two thirds of the population of Linz live in these areas. With selected representatives of these CCSRAs, the greening potential was identified and climate adaptive strategies developed. A survey carried out in selected CCSRAs showed a high appreciation for urban green areas (83.3 to 86.7 percent) by the inhabitants but a very low trust (35.0 to 56.7 percent) in their ability to contribute to the reduction of thermal load. Most residents would support an increase of different types of urban greenery in their residential areas (e.g., 76.7 to 91.7 percent would support an increase in lawns); at the same time, there is a high rejection of unsealing measures (e.g., 38.9 to 57.5 percent reject a lower number of parking lots). Greening measures, which would not require a change of surface structures such as facade greening, are the least accepted greening measures (38.9 to 57.5 percent reject this possibility). In the opinion of most inhabitants, residents should decide on the green structure of their residential areas (69.4 and 76.7 percent), while only a minority would approve of the involvement of urban planners (40.0 to 43.3 percent) or experts and scientists (16.7 to 30.0 percent) in this process. The results show an informational and educational deficit on the subject of climate change impact at a local level. The greening potential in CCSRAs is still not sufficiently valued by decision-makers and inhabitants, and adaptation strategies in the urban development of the areas are lacking.

Besides, the presence of high-intensity radiation sources like, for example, the sun, may appreciably modify the radiant field to which people are exposed. As a consequence, this could alter notably the comfort conditions. In order of properly taking into account this issue, a simple analytical method is introduced in this work, that allows the easy evaluation of the thermal radiant field induced by the presence of the solar radiation.

For this purpose, a general methodology has been designed that could serve as an example for other areas. First, potential bicycle users in the city are characterized and identified through a household survey, which included a complete travel diary. Then they were asked to participate in a stated preference survey designed to find out the relative importance of certain key variables, previously identified, associated with making bicycle journeys. These data were used to estimate mixed logit models allowing to correctly treat the pseudopanel nature of the data. The results indicate that the most important variables among potential users are the cost and the climate, followed by the availability of infrastructure such as cycle paths and an extensive network of both public and private bicycle d...},

@article{Hansen2005,
abstract = {We use a global climate model to compare the effectiveness of many climate forcing agents for producing climate change. We find a substantial range in the "efficacy'' of different forcings, where the efficacy is the global temperature response per unit forcing relative to the response to CO2 forcing. Anthropogenic CH4 has efficacy similar to 110{\%}, which increases to similar to 145{\%} when its indirect effects on stratospheric H2O and tropospheric O-3 are included, yielding an effective climate forcing of similar to 0.8 W/m(2) for the period 1750 - 2000 and making CH4 the largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than CO2. Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning have a calculated efficacy similar to 58{\%}, while fossil fuel BC has an efficacy similar to 78{\%}. Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning BC + OC has a negative forcing. We show that replacement of the traditional instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and temperature changes in a fixed-ocean model run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial distribution of climate change, normalized to the same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents, suggesting that the global forcing has more relevance to regional climate change than may have been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases intensify the Hadley circulation in our model, increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia, while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics including the Southwest United States, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an expanding Sahel. These features survive in model simulations that use all estimated forcings for the period 1880 - 2000. Responses to localized forcings, such as land use change and heavy regional concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific regional characteristics. We suggest that anthropogenic tropospheric O-3 and the BC snow albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing, Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its efficacy. Fe requires calculation of the climate response and introduces greater model dependence, but once it is calculated for a given amount of a forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the response to other forcing amounts.},

abstract = {Researchers are working to identify and promote environment and policy initiatives to encourage more active and healthy communities. Measuring environmental attributes through objective means can verify which physical environment factors are most important. We describe how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) may be used to measure objectively, the features of the built environment that may influence walking. We show how four key attributes currently believed to be of most relevance to walking for transport may be used to create a ‘walkability' index. These are dwelling density (higher-density neighbourhoods support greater retail and service variety, resulting in shorter, walkable distances between facilities; driving and parking are more difficult); street connectivity (higher intersection density provides people with a greater choice of potential routes, easier access to major roads where public transport is available and shorter times to get to destinations); land use mix (the more varied the land use mix and built form, the more conducive it is to walk to various destinations); and net retail area (people who live near multiple and diverse retail opportunities are able to make more frequent and shorter shopping trips by walking and can walk to more local employment opportunities). The potential relationships between each of the objective environmental-attribute measures and walking behaviours is discussed, together with suggestions as to how such measures might be used to guide community infrastructure planning. GIS mapping can assist decision makers in where to focus transportation investments and where to guide future growth. Readily accessible GIS data can be used to guide and support urban planning and infrastructure investment decisions in both the private and public sectors, to increase walking in communities.},

abstract = {1. Seedling relative growth rate ({\{}RGR){\}} is often decomposed into the product of specific leaf area (leaf area per leaf mass, {\{}SLA){\}}, net assimilation rate (rate of mass increase per unit leaf area per unit time, {\{}NARa){\}} and leaf mass ratio (ratio of leaf to total dry mass, {\{}LMR).{\}} Commonly, most cross-species variation in {\{}RGR{\}} is accounted for by variation in {\{}SLA{\}}, while no general relationships occur between {\{}RGR{\}} and either {\{}NARa{\}} or {\{}LMR.{\}} {\{}NARa{\}} can be factored into the product of leaf nitrogen productivity (rate of mass increase per unit leaf nitrogen per unit time, {\{}LNP){\}} and leaf nitrogen concentration (area basis, {\{}LNCa).{\}} In this way the influence on {\{}RGR{\}} of leaf nitrogen - how it is displayed, and how it is utilized - can be investigated. 2. Seedlings of 28 Australian woody dicot species were grown under controlled, favourable conditions. Variation in {\{}SLA{\}}, {\{}LNP{\}}, {\{}LNCa{\}} and {\{}LMR{\}} explained c. 44{\%}, 22{\%}, 19{\%} and 15{\%} of variation in {\{}RGR{\}}, respectively. {\{}SLA{\}} and {\{}LNP{\}} were positively associated with {\{}RGR{\}}, while {\{}LNCa{\}} was negatively associated with {\{}RGR.{\}} {\{}LNP{\}} and {\{}LNCa{\}} were negatively correlated, the counteracting trends between {\{}RGR{\}} and each of these attributes resulting in no relationship between {\{}RGR{\}} and {\{}NARa.{\}} It is argued that this phenomenon may be widespread and may contribute to the inconsistency of reported relationships between {\{}NARa{\}} and {\{}RGR.{\}} 3. The functional balance between leaves and roots can be described in terms of mass allocation and morphology (static ratios or allometric coefficients) or, alternatively, in terms of leaf 'activity' ({\{}NAR){\}} and root 'activity' (nitrogen uptake rate, {\{}NUR).{\}} At any given time most species allocated greater mass to leaves than to roots, but species with low {\{}RGR{\}} tended to be partitioning a greater ongoing proportion of new biomass to the roots rather than to the leaves, resulting in a proportionally greater increase in root surface compared with leaf surface over time. Nitrogen uptake rate was correlated with leaf and whole-plant nitrogen concentration, but not with other attributes. While it is clear that root and leaf functions must be coordinated (and thus in balance) for growth to occur, there is little evidence that this balance varies systematically with {\{}RGR{\}} across all species.},

abstract = {Many inhabitants of cities throughout the world suffer from health problems and discomfort that are caused by overheating of urban areas, and there is compelling evidence that these problems will be exacerbated by global climate change. Most cities are not designed to ameliorate these effects although it is well-known that this is possible, especially through evidence-based climate-responsive design of urban open spaces. Urban parks and green spaces have the potential to provide thermally comfortable environments and help reduce vulnerability to heat stress. However, in order for them to provide this function, parks must be designed within the context of the prevailing climate and predicted future climates. To analyze the effects of elements that alter microclimate in parks, we used human energy budget simulations. We modelled the outdoor human energy budget in a range of warm to hot climate zones and interpreted the results in terms of thermal comfort and health vulnerability. Reduction of solar radiant input with trees had the greatest effect in all test cities. Reduction in air temperature was the second-most important component, and in some climates was nearly as important as incorporating shade. We then conducted similar modelling using predicted climates for the middle of the century, emphasizing the importance of city-level efforts for park design to assist in minimizing future climate-related urban health risks. These simulations suggested that heat waves in many climates will produce outdoor environments where people will be in extreme danger of heat stress, but that appropriately designed parks can reduce the threat.},

Given the fleet size and travel times between demand collection nodes, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to optimize the service area and transit route planning concurrently. The proposed model features a two-level structure with an upper level to maximize the number of served passengers by the feeder transit system and a lower level to minimize the operational cost for transit operators. This paper further presents a heuristic approach to yield acceptable solutions to the model in a reasonable amount of time. Case study results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model as well as the heuristic solution approach.},

abstract = {Land uses such as cattle ranching require important decisions concerning the protection of habitats and species. This is especially true in arid lands and typically involves habitat regrowth as well as the establishment of protected areas. However, the manner in which species respond to the protected area or to the surrounding matrix may vary depending on their ecology, particularly habitat requirements. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of one such protected dryland area (MaB Reserve of {\~{N}}acu{\~{n}}{\'{a}}n) and adjacent rangelands in the central Monte Desert of Argentina. More speciﬁcally, how effective it is in ensuring the conservation of small and medium-sized mammals. Mammal richness and abundance estimated from both trapping and indirect signs were compared in different habitats inside and outside the Reserve. After over 50 years of livestock exclusion in {\~{N}}acu{\~{n}}{\'{a}}n, our results showed signiﬁcant changes in habitat structure and mammal diversity between protected and unprotected areas. Species associated with high plant cover were found inside the Reserve, while the surrounding areas were occupied by those adapted to open habitats. The presence of the endangered Dolichotis patagonum in rangelands outside the Reserve demonstrates that unprotected areas play a major role in conserving species diversity.},

@article{Haythorpe2012,
abstract = {Invasive species present economic and ecological challenges worldwide. In many cases we are not aware of the full effect they have on the environment, the extent of any damage, or the factors contributing to their success. In this study we examined the foraging aggression of wild Common Mynas (Sturnus tristis) as a potential explanation for their invasive success, and quantiﬁed the effect of this behaviour on other birds. Common Mynas did not display signiﬁcantly more aggression than other species, and displayed signiﬁcantly less aggression than native Australian Magpies (Cracticus tibicen). Furthermore, the presence of Common Mynas at a feeding resource had no greater effect on the abundance of heterospeciﬁc individuals than the presence of any other species. Presence of each species was negatively correlated with the presence of other species, that is all species were less likely to approach the feeding station if any other species was present there. Common Mynas also did not displace other birds at feeding sites any more frequently than three of the other four species, and less frequently than two other native species. Overall, the ﬁndings suggest that Common Mynas do not display more food- related aggression than other species in suburban habitats, suggesting that competitive aggression over food is not likely to be one of the behavioural traits leading to the success of Common Mynas in suburban habitats.},

abstract = {This paper argues that research into the wellbeing and restorative effects of green spaces has been conducted in what might be described as a modal vacuum. Whilst it is commonly recognised that the outdoor world is one in which our visual, aural, haptic and olfactory senses are engaged, much environmental psychological research into this topic has been conducted using the visual sense only. We present a methodological overview of research that has been conducted either in situ or in conjunction with other modes (primarily aural), and highlight research findings from other disciplines that contributes to our understanding of greenspace wellbeing benefits. Lastly, we outline a research approach that we believe could uncover some of the underlying mechanisms of wellbeing benefits from greenspace. We contend that the use of eyetracking, in conjunction with the presentation of sound as well as visual stimuli, could help unpick the complexities of what exactly it is about certain environments that makes them restorative or not.},

abstract = {Recent trends in information technology show that citizens are increasingly willing to share information using tools provided by Web 2.0 and crowdsourcing platforms to describe events that may have social impact. This is fuelled by the proliferation of location-aware devices such as smartphones and tablets; users are able to share information in these crowdsourcing platforms directly from the ﬁeld at real time, augmenting this information with its location. Afterwards, to retrieve this information, users must deal with the different search mechanisms provided by the each Web 2.0 services. This paper explores how to improve on the interoperability of Web 2.0 services by providing a single service as a unique entry to search over several Web 2.0 services in a single step. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the Open Geospatial Consortium's OpenSearch Geospatial and Time speciﬁcation as an interface for a service that searches and retrieves information available in crowdsourcing services. We present how this information is valuable in complementing other authoritative information by providing an alternative, contemporary source. We demonstrate the intrinsic interoperability of the system showing the integration of crowd-sourced data in different scenarios.},

abstract = {Trees show considerable variation and flexibility in their size of crowns, height and stem diameter at breast height (dbh). Dbh has been used as predictor variables in diameter and height growth equations. Relationships between dbh, tree height, crown length, crown height and crown ratio of Vitellaria paradoxa were investigated and regression prediction models were derived. Dbh, as a predictor variable, was positively correlated with tree height and crown length (F0.05 (1), 8). The correlation coefficients of determination (r 2 ) were 0.447 and 0.399, respectively. The dbh has no correlation with crown height and crown ratio. Here the r 2 were 0.241 and 0.051, respectively. Stronger correlation was observed when crown length, as a predictor variable, was used against tree height and crown height. The r 2 values were 0.522 and 0.497, respectively. Hence, regression prediction models derived from this study suggests that the use of crown length as predictor variable is more accurate than the use of dbh in estimating tree height and crown height.},

abstract = {Much attention is being directed to the measurement and modeling of surface-atmosphere exchanges of CO2 for different surface types. However, as yet, few measurements have been conducted in cities, even though these environments are widely acknowledged to be major sources of anthropogenic CO2. This paper highlights some of the challenges facing micrometeorologists attempting to use eddy covariance techniques to directly monitor CO2 fluxes in urban environments, focusing on the inherent variability within and between urban areas, and the importance of scale and the appropriate height of measurements. Results from a very short-term study of CO2 fluxes, undertaken in Chicago, Illinois in the summer of 1995, are presented. Mid-afternoon minimum CO2 concentrations and negative fluxes are attributed to the strength of biospheric photosynthesis and strong mixing of local anthropogenic sources in a deep mixed layer. Poor night-time atmospheric mixing, lower mixed layer depths, biospheric respiration, and continued missions from mobile and fixed anthropogenic sources, account for the night-time maxima in CO2 concentrations. The need for more, longer-term, continuous eddy covariance measurements is stressed.},

abstract = {The paper makes a case for the adoption of common methods in urban heat island (UHI) research and its application. Strict attention to issues of scale, experimental design, site classification, instrument exposure and metadata could greatly improve the present situation. Too often lack of simple scientific rigour leads to sloppy or .erroneous measurement or modeling efforts, and misdirected attempts to ameliorate urban thermal climates It seems the scientific value of much UHI work is compromised by lack of rigour in the design and conduct of experimental work. Most critical is explicit recognition of scale because that underpins conceptualization of the ,study question, sets the size of the scalar source area for temperature, guides interpretation of the data establishes the time and space scales of any modeling framework and sets the usefulness of the results in .practical applications A review of the literature on observed UHI shows that experimental design, choice of sites, exposure of instruments and documentation of metadata often leave much to be desired. The many descriptive studies are not matched by those looking at UHI processes at the different scales so models may be missing relevant processes or ignore significant interactions with other scales. Further, some models have been tested against data from the wrong scale of UHI. Finally, the practical application of UHI results faces difficulties because users, who are often .not UHI specialists, may misconstrue the applicability of the data to their needs The resolution of these problems may be surprisingly uncomplicated. It mainly requires those involved in UHI work to truly appreciate the significance of scale in urban climates and to carry that understanding through all .aspects of a study uniform},

abstract = {This study compiled recent inventory data from 929,823 street trees in 50 cities to determine trends in tree number and density, identify priority investments and create baseline data against which the efficacy of future practices can be evaluated. The number of street trees increased from 5.9 million in 1988 to 9.1 million in 2014, about one for every four residents. Street tree density declined from 65.6 to 46.6 trees per km, nearly a 30{\%} drop. City streets are at 36.3{\%} of full stocking. State-wide, only London planetree (Platanus ?? hispanica) comprises over 10{\%} of the total, suggesting good state-wide species diversity. However, at the city scale, 39 communities were overly reliant on a single species. The state's street trees remove 567,748 t CO2 (92,253 t se) annually, equivalent to taking 120,000 cars off the road. Their asset value is {\$}2.49 billion ({\$}75.1 million se). The annual value (USD) of all ecosystem services is {\$}1.0 billion ({\$}58.3 million se), or {\$}110.63 per tree ({\$}29.17 per capita). Given an average annual per tree management cost of {\$}19.00, {\$}5.82 in benefit is returned for every {\$}1 spent. Management implications could include establishing an aggressive program to plant the 16 million vacant sites and replace removed trees, while restricting planting of overabundant species. Given the tree population's youth there is likely need to invest in pruning young trees for structure and form, which can reduce subsequent costs for treating defects in mature trees.},

abstract = {The aim was to investigate the relations between diameter at breast height and maximum crown diameter, tree height and other possible independent variables available in stand databases. Altogether 76 models for estimating stem diameter at breast height and 60 models for tree age were formulated using height and maximum crown diameter as independent variables. These types of models can be utilized in modern remote sensing applications where tree crown dimensions and tree height are measured automatically. Data from Finnish national forest inventory sample plots located throughout the country were used to develop the models, and a separate test site was used to evaluate them. The RMSEs of the diameter models for the entire country varied between 7.3{\%} and 14.9{\%} from the mean diameter depending on the combination of independent variables and spe- cies. The RMSEs of the age models for entire country ranged from 9.2{\%} to 12.8{\%} from the mean age. The regional models were formulated from a data set in which the country was divided into four geographical areas. These regional models reduced local error and gave better results than the general models. The standard deviation of the dbh estimate for the separate test site was almost 5 cm when maximum crown width alone was the independent variable. The deviation was smallest for birch. When tree height was the only independent variable, the standard devia- tion was about 3 cm, and when both height and maximum crown width were included it was under 3 cm. In the latter case, the deviation was equally small (11{\%}) for birch and Norway spruce and greatest (13{\%}) for Scots pine.},

abstract = {Assessing impacts of future anthropogenic carbon emissions is currently impeded by uncertainties in our knowledge of equilibrium climate sensitivity to atmospheric carbon dioxide doubling. Previous studies suggest 3 K as best estimate, 2 to 4.5 K as the 66{\%} probability range, and nonzero probabilities for much higher values, the latter implying a small but significant chance of high-impact climate changes that would be difficult to avoid. Here, combining extensive sea and land surface temperature reconstructions from the Last Glacial Maximum with climate model simulations, we estimate a lower median (2.3 K) and reduced uncertainty (1.7 to 2.6 K 66{\%} probability). Assuming paleoclimatic constraints apply to the future as predicted by our model, these results imply lower probability of imminent extreme climatic change than previously thought.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the process of assessing tower footprint climatology, spatial variability of site vegetation density based on satellite image analysis, and sensor location bias in scaling up to 1 km × 1 km patch. Three flat sites with different vegetation cover and surface heterogeneity were selected from AmeriFlux tower sites: the oak/grass site and the annual grassland site in a savannah ecosystem in northern California and a slash pine forest site in Florida, USA. The site vegetation density was expressed in terms of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and crown closure (CC) by analyzing the high-resolution IKONOS satellite image. At each site, the spatial structure of vegetation density was characterized using semivariogram and window size analyses. Footprint maps were produced by a simple model based on the analytical solution of the Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. The resulting horizontal arrays of footprint functions were then superimposed with those of NDVI and CC. Annual sensor location biases for the oak/grass and the pine forest sites were {\textless}4{\%} for both NDVI and CC, requiring no flux corrections in scaling from tower to landscape of 1 km2. Although the annual grassland site displayed much larger location biases (28{\%} for NDVI, 94{\%} for CC), their temporal changes associated with averaging time showed a real potential to develop algorithms aimed at upscaling tower fluxes to the landscape in an effort to provide validation data for MODIS products. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The present study aimed to evaluate evaporative heat transfer of dairy cows bred in a hot semi-arid environment. Cutaneous (E(S)) and respiratory (E(R)) evaporation were measured (810 observations) in 177 purebred and crossbred Holstein cows from five herds located in the equatorial semi-arid region, and one herd in the subtropical region of Brazil. Rectal temperature (T(R)), hair coat surface temperature (T(S)) and respiratory rate (F(R)) were also measured. Observations were made in the subtropical region from August to December, and in the semi-arid region from April to July. Measurements were done from 1100 to 1600 hours, after cows remained in a pen exposed to the sun. Environmental variables measured in the same locations as the animals were black globe temperature (T(G)), air temperature (T(A)), wind speed (U), and partial air vapour pressure (P(V)). Data were analysed by mixed models, using the least squares method. Results showed that average E(S) and E(R) were higher in the semi-arid region (117.2 W m(-2) and 44.0 W m(-2), respectively) than in the subtropical region (85.2 W m(-2) and 30.2 W m(-2), respectively). Herds and individual cows were significant effects (P {\textless} 0.01) for all traits in the semi-arid region. Body parts did not affect T(S) and E(S) in the subtropical region, but was a significant effect (P {\textless} 0.01) in the semi-arid region. The average flank T(S) (42.8°C) was higher than that of the neck and hindquarters (39.8°C and 41.6°C, respectively). Average E(S) was higher in the neck (133.3 W m(-2)) than in the flank (116.2 W m(-2)) and hindquarters (98.6 W m(-2)). Coat colour affected significantly both T(S) and E(S) (P {\textless} 0.01). Black coats had higher T(S) and E(S) in the semi-arid region (41.7°C and 117.2 W m(-2), respectively) than white coats (37.2°C and 106.7 W m(-2), respectively). Rectal temperatures were almost the same in both subtropical and semi-arid regions. The results highlight the need for improved management methods specific for semi-arid regions.},

abstract = {Leaves from 26 species with growth forms from annual herbs to trees were collected from open, intermediate, and shaded understory habitats in Mississippi and Kansas, USA. Leaf optical properties including reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance in visible and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths were measured along with leaf thickness and specific leaf mass (SLM). These leaf properties and internal light scattering have been reported to vary with light availability in studies that have focused on a limited number of species. Our objective was to determine whether these patterns in leaf optics and light availability were consistent when a greater number of species were evaluated. Leaf thickness and SLM varied by tenfold among species sampled, but within-habitat variance was high. Although there was a strong trend toward thicker leaves in open habitats, only SLM was significantly greater in open vs. understory habitats. In contrast, leaf optical properties were strikingly similar among habitats. Reflectance and reflectance/transmittance in the NIR were used to estimate internal light scattering and there were strong relationships (r1 {\textgreater} 0.65) between these optical properties and leaf thickness. We concluded that leaf thickness, which did not vary consistently among habitats, was the best predictor of NIR reflectance and internal light scattering. However, because carbon allocation to leaves was lower in understory species (low SLM) yet gross optical properties were similar among all habitats, the energy investment by shade leaves required to achieve optical equivalence with sun leaves was lower. Differences in leaf longevity and growth form within a habitat may help explain the lack of consistent patterns in leaf optics as the number of species sampled increases.},

@article{Heckert2015,
abstract = {The Philadelphia Water Department has committed to taking a green infrastructure (GI) approach to reduce stormwater runoff and prevent combined sewer overflow events. Promoting GI as a stormwater management technique in a city necessitates development of a more distributed urban environmental management system, through which the city's water department needs to coordinate with a wide range of public and private stakeholders, shifting power from the utility to these other stakeholders. We argue that distributed urban environmental management can lead to more inclusive outcomes but only if there is an intentionality about how funds are distributed, which communities are prioritized, how partners are chosen and cultivated, and which types of projects are implemented in which neighborhoods. We suggest the development of an equity index to help identify communities that would most benefit from GI investment as critical for equitable GI planning. Using Philadelphia as a test case, we develop a Green Infrastructure Equity Index, designed with the indirect benefits of green infrastructure in mind, to determine which communities could benefit the most from investment in GI based on their "equity void ranking". We argue that developing a GI Equity Index provides a much more nuanced analysis of communities that takes into account the built environment as well as the underlying social and economic conditions. The GI Equity Index also allows for a shift in the way we define equity. In doing so, it (1) changes the conversation about equity in GI planning using careful data analysis that takes into account both socio-economic and built environment variables; (2) provides a visual tool that communities can use to understand underlying conditions and the existing placement of GI; and (3) serves as a framework that can be tailored to allow communities to weight their priorities, putting more power in their hands.},

@phdthesis{Krayenhoff2014a,
abstract = {Over 50{\%} of the world's population lives in cities, many of which are hot, polluted, and expanding. The design of cities impacts local meteorology and climate, which affect building energy use and the comfort and health of urban residents. Numerical models that incorporate the relevant urban elements and physical processes can predict these effects and guide management strategies. Addition of vegetation is a key design strategy for moderation of local urban climate, and many cities already boast extensive vegetation. Relative to shorter vegetation, urban trees have unique effects on local climate and pollutant dispersion: they provide shade and shelter, interacting with buildings and streets to alter climate and wind flow. Urban canopy models (UCMs) predict neighbourhood-scale (10² – 10⁴ m) energy exchange and climate of atmospheric layers between and above the buildings. Few UCMs represent the urban canopy with multiple layers, which permit more flexible and process-based representation of canopy physics. Most UCMs neglect vegetation, or incorporate it with a separate model, neglecting interaction between vegetation and built elements. This dissertation develops BEP-Tree, the first multi-layer urban canopy model that explicitly includes trees and their interaction with buildings. It consists of an existing multi-layer UCM, a foliage energy balance model, and two major developments: firstly, a model that distributes solar and infrared radiation amongst tree foliage, road, roof, and wall elements at multiple heights, accounting for radiation ‘trapping' and mutual shading; secondly, parameterization of building and tree foliage effects on flow, including generation and dissipation of turbulence, drag on the mean wind, and explicit consideration of sheltering. The combined model permits a range of building and tree configurations, and makes possible advanced assessment of impacts of trees on urban climate, air quality, human comfort and building energy loads. BEP-Tree is compared with measurements from the Sunset neighbourhood in Vancouver, Canada. Urban trees channel sensible heat into latent heat (evaporation), shift surface-atmosphere energy exchange upwards, slow canopy wind, and dissipate turbulence, especially if taller than nearby buildings. Effects of trees on canopy thermal climate depend on representation of neighbourhood-scale foliage clumping in radiation versus dynamical processes, and further theoretical advances are required.},

The aims are to provide simple predictive expressions for practical applications, and to rationalize existing laboratory and atmospheric data into a single framework. Using dimensional analysis and two physical hypotheses, theoretical predictions are developed for total stress (described by the square root of the canopy drag coefficient), stress partition (described by the ratio tau(S)/tau of the streSS tau(S) on the underlying ground surface to total stress tau), zero-plane displacement and roughness length. The stress partition prediction is the simple equation tau(S)/tau = 1/(1 + betalambda), where beta = C(R)/C(S) is the ratio of element and surface drag coefficients. This prediction agrees very well with data and is free of adjustable constants. Other predictions also agree well with a range of laboratory and atmospheric data.},

abstract = {Microclimatic effects were investigated for human thermal sensation on human bioclimatic maps in summer, 2009 using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). Study locations were downtown Nanaimo, BC, Canada and Changwon, Republic of Korea. Air temperatures and humidities of several sites were collected at the two locations. Mean radiant temperatures of outdoor study areas in high resolution were simulated with the HURES human-urban radiation exchange simulation model. Wind speeds estimated using the ENVI-met model were corrected using collected wind speed data and adjusted from one to ten meters above the surface via UTCI's wind speed converting formula. Greatest heat stress was around mid-afternoon. Sunny areas had moderate to strong heat stress, 28-38°C UTCI. Shady areas had no thermal stress to moderate heat stress, 20-27°C UTCI. Narrow streets had lower UTCI's than open spaces in both areas. A 1ms-1 reduction in 10m height wind speed (u) increased UTCI by 1°C. In this study, u varied by up to 3.3ms-1. Observed direct beam solar radiation variations changed UTCI by three heat stress levels, diffuse and reflected solar radiation and longwave radiation changed it by 1.5 levels and u altered UTCI by half a level. UTCI is an accepted, easy to determine human thermal index whose results can be mapped as human bioclimatic maps and should be a useful tool for analyzing possible outdoor human thermal effects of urban and landscape planning and design. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{George2007,
abstract = {The ongoing problems in business leadership over the past five years have underscored the need for a new kind of leader in the twenty-first century: the authentic leader. Author Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor and the former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, and his colleagues, conducted the largest leadership development study ever undertaken. They interviewed 125 business leaders from different racial, religious, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds to understand how leaders become and remain authentic. Their interviews showed that you do not have to be born with any particular characteristics or traits to lead. You also do not have to be at the top of your organization. Anyone can learn to be an authentic leader. The journey begins with leaders understanding their life stories. Authentic leaders frame their stories in ways that allow them to see themselves not as passive observers but as individuals who learn from their experiences. These leaders make time to examine their experiences and to reflect on them, and in doing so they grow as individuals and as leaders. Authentic leaders also work hard at developing self-awareness through persistent and often courageous self-exploration. Denial can be the greatest hurdle that leaders face in becoming self-aware, but authentic leaders ask for, and listen to, honest feedback. They also use formal and informal support networks to help them stay grounded and lead integrated lives. The authors argue that achieving business results over a sustained period of time is the ultimate mark of authentic leadership. It may be possible to drive short-term outcomes without being authentic, but authentic leadership is the only way to create long-term results.},

abstract = {This study contributes to the literature on walkability measurement by proposing a hybrid auditing method that combines the efficiency of a GIS-based approach with the pedestrian perspective possible with Google Street View. The paper first reviews the various in-person and secondary source auditing methods that have been developed over the past decade. It then tests the feasibility of a GIS/Google Street View hybrid method against an in-person auditing method. The approach here is based on the Irvine-Minnesota Inventory (IMI), selecting 94 objectively measured items that were available and accessible using a combination of GIS and Google Street View. The goal was to test the degree to which some of the measures employed in IMI could be streamlined using GIS and Google Street View as data sources. It is concluded that the combination of information from Google Street View and updated GIS layers can be an effective way of obtaining physical environment data that is very comparable to in-person observation.

abstract = {Planning and designing for walking is crucial for promoting a healthy public life, creating sustainable neighborhoods, enhancing social life and economy. This research paper identifies the factors that contribute to increased urban walkability in order to improve neighborhood sustainability and public life. For the research to gauge the perception of walkability, a case study was conducted in a neighborhood that provided an opportunity to analyze the walking behavior of pedestrians in a variety of urban built environment. Mehrauli, one of the most traditional settlements in New Delhi, India, was taken up for primary case study as it functioned like an urban laboratory with both traditional and modern settlements in the same vicinity. Streets selected based on varying levels of usage by pedestrians were studied through activity mapping and public surveys to understand the underlying factors that led to certain streets being rendered more walkable than the others. The results showed that the most important factors affecting pedestrians' perception of walkbility were related to the built envelop on either side of the streets. Factors relating to urban morphology like enclosure, block length and edge conditions were found crucial in creating the perception of a walkable neighborhood.},

abstract = {: Despite much enthusiasm among practitioners to spur rates of bicycle commuting via promotional measures such as community rides or commuter incentive programs, there is little research regarding their impact. Using data from one such event, Bike-to-Work Day (BTWD), this paper aims to understand the following: (1) who attends BTWD; (2) the impacts of these event-based promotional strategies across different groups; and (3) lessons for increasing commuter cycling in general. The authors assess these research questions by examining motives to participate, behavior change, and influences of the event using over 1,000 surveys collected in the Denver region. Using an ordered logit model, the authors then identify significant factors for grouping cyclists' by behavior category. The results suggest that event attendees vary widely, from those who only bicycle on BTWD to those who report year-round bicycling, while reasons for participation and impacts of participation vary across bicycling behavior groups. This research also identifies specific barriers to increased commuter cycling. While the long-term impact of such events remains uncertain, this research illustrates that BTWD has the unique ability to capture a wide range of bicyclists and provide insights into barriers impacting diverse cycling populations.

abstract = {The representation of the influence of vegetation on meteorological variables inside the urban canopy is a modeling challenge. The interaction of vegetation canopy parameterization for urban regions in mesoscale modeling was implemented and analyzed in this work. The BRAMS model equipped with the TEB was used to simulate a calm wind and clear sky period in the Metropolitan Area of S??o Paulo. The impact of vegetated areas on cities was estimated by calculating the surface fluxes due to vegetation and artificial materials, weighing individual contributions by using each component fraction inside a model grid. An evaluation of the vegetation impact on atmospheric conditions was made by comparing simulated temperature and specific humidity with surface observations, atmospheric sounding values and land-surface temperature product retrieved from MODIS/TERRA. The inclusion of vegetation clearly improves the simulated air temperature, the vertical structure of the urban boundary layer and the calculation of surface fluxes. Although some improvements in the model are still necessary, it is clear that the model is very sensitive to the presence of the vegetation and continuous efforts should be made to better understand the related process and to provide better tools for urban planning and other important activities in urban areas.},

Leaf parameters and optical properties (reflectance, transmittance, absorbance) in PAR, FR and NIR wavebands (400–1100 nm) were preliminarily submitted to a canonical correlation analysis where lamina thickness and water content showed a leading role in determining all the optical properties, while chlorophyll, influential in the PAR region, was remarkably effective only in an extreme pigment situation when green and albino patches of ivy leaves were compared. Transmittance appeared inversely related to lamina thickness in accordance with the Lambert Beer law. Significant correlations were found also between mesophyll water content and both transmittance (positive) and reflectance (negative). Olive leaves showed peculiar optical patterns because of the dense and continuous trichome layer on their abaxial surface.},

@article{Viola2012,
abstract = {This study introduces a water-driven crop model aiming to quantitatively link olive yield to climate and soil moisture dynamics using an ecohydrological approach. A mathematical model describing soil moisture, evapotranspiration and assimilation dynamics of olive orchards is developed here. The model is able to explicitly reproduce two different hydroclimatic phases in Mediterranean areas: the well-watered conditions in which evapotranspiration and assimilation assume their maximum values and the real conditions where the limitations induced by soil moisture availability are taken into account. Annual olive yield is obtained by integrating the carbon assimilation during the growing season, including the effects of vegetation water stress on biomass allocation. This numerical model has been tested on an olive orchard located in Sicily (Italy) obtaining a satisfactory reproduction of historical olive yield data. This model is useful for simulating the influence of soil moisture dynamic on biomass growth, fruit productivity, also in a context of climatic change.

@article{Taleghani2016,
abstract = {The urban heat island impacts the thermal comfort of pedestrians in cities. In this paper, the effects of four heat mitigation strategies on micrometeorology and the thermal comfort of pedestrians were simulated for a neighborhood in eastern Los Angeles County. The strategies investigated include solar reflective 'cool roofs', vegetative 'green roofs', solar reflective 'cool pavements', and increased street-level trees. A series of micrometeorological simulations for an extreme heat day were carried out assuming widespread adoption of each mitigation strategy. Comparing each simulation to the control simulation assuming current land cover for the neighborhood showed that additional street-trees and cool pavements reduced 1.5 m air temperature, while cool and green roofs mostly provided cooling at heights above pedestrian level. However, cool pavements increased reflected sunlight from the ground to pedestrians at a set of unshaded receptor locations. This reflected radiation intensified the mean radiant temperature and consequently increased physiological equivalent temperature (PET) by 2.2 °C during the day, reducing the thermal comfort of pedestrians. At another set of receptor locations that were on average 5 m from roadways and underneath preexisting tree cover, cool pavements caused significant reductions in surface air temperatures and small changes in mean radiant temperature during the day, leading to decreases in PET of 1.1 °C, and consequent improvements in thermal comfort. For improving thermal comfort of pedestrians during the afternoon in unshaded locations, adding street trees was found to be the most effective strategy. However, afternoon thermal comfort improvements in already shaded locations adjacent to streets were most significant for cool pavements. Green and cool roofs showed the lowest impact on the thermal comfort of pedestrians since they modify the energy balance at roof level, above the height of pedestrians.},

Changes in heat-related mortality are estimated for four countries: the United States, Canada, the People's Republic of China and Egypt. In addition, the potential confounding impact of increased air pollution is considered. Finally, a framework to analyze two vector-borne diseases, onchocerciasis and malaria, which may spread if temperatures increase, is discussed. Our findings suggest that heat-related mortality is estimated to rise significantly in all four countries if the earth warms, with the greatest impacts in China and Egypt. The most sensitive areas are those with intense but irregular heat waves. In the United States, air pollution does not appear to impact daily mortality significantly when severe weather is present, although it seems to have a slight influence when weather conditions are not stressful.},

abstract = {Issue addressed Growing evidence shows that higher-density, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly neighbourhoods encourage active transport, including transport-related walking. Despite widespread recognition of the benefits of creating more walkable neighbourhoods, there remains a gap between the rhetoric of the need for walkability and the creation of walkable neighbourhoods. Moreover, there is little objective data to benchmark the walkability of neighbourhoods within and between Australian cities in order to monitor planning and design intervention progress and to assess built environment and urban policy interventions required to achieve increased walkability. This paper describes a demonstration project that aimed to develop, trial and validate a 'Walkability Index Tool' that could be used by policy makers and practitioners to assess the walkability of local areas; or by researchers to access geospatial data assessing walkability. The overall aim of the project was to develop an automated geospatial tool capable of creating walkability indices for neighbourhoods at user-specified scales. Methods The tool is based on open-source software architecture, within the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN) framework, and incorporates key sub-component spatial measures of walkability (street connectivity, density and land use mix). Results Using state-based data, we demonstrated it was possible to create an automated walkability index. However, due to the lack of availability of consistent of national data measuring land use mix, at this stage it has not been possible to create a national walkability measure. The next stage of the project is to increase useability of the tool within the AURIN portal and to explore options for alternative spatial data sources that will enable the development of a valid national walkability index. Conclusion AURIN's open-source Walkability Index Tool is a first step in demonstrating the potential benefit of a tool that could measure walkability across Australia. It also demonstrates the value of making accurate spatial data available for research purposes. So what? There remains a gap between urban policy and practice, in terms of creating walkable neighbourhoods. When fully implemented, AURIN's walkability tool could be used to benchmark Australian cities against which planning and urban design decisions could be assessed to monitor progress towards achieving policy goals. Making cleaned data readily available for research purposes through a common portal could also save time and financial resources.},

Measures to mitigate the urban heat island include increasing green urban areas and altering the form of cities. Research is needed to explore the impacts of urban form on the surface urban heat island. Research strategy: Data on land surface temperatures for summer 2001 and land cover are combined with meteorological, demographic, and topographic data for European urban regions, delineated as larger urban zones. To ensure a comprehensive view, three ways of quantifying surface urban heat island are calculated and stratified for morning and evening, and climate zones. Linear models reveal the relative influence of the four factors: (1) composition (e.g., share of different land covers in the urban region), (2) configuration (e.g., spatial arrangement), (3) location (e.g., distance to coast or elevation), and (4) population.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Much of the research into cyclist safety in Australia has focused on behaviour with less focus on the impact of the urban transport environment on cyclist safety. A greater understanding of the urban transport system and the improvements needed to create a safer cycling environment are essential if cyclists are to be safe and increased cycling participation targets are to be achieved. The proposed study will use existing cyclist crash data along with unique cyclist exposure data to develop road infrastructure prototypes that improve cyclists' safety and evaluate the effectiveness of these prototypes in a cycling simulator.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND DESIGN: This study will be conducted in two Australian cities namely Perth and Melbourne as both cities have policies that strongly advocate cycling. Two methods of data collection will be employed: (1) in-depth crash investigations of injured cyclists; and (2) video footage of cyclist exposure through a naturalistic cycling study of non-injured cyclists. The findings from these two methods will be used to develop new urban road design prototypes which will be tested with a sample of cyclists and motorists in safe environment namely, a cycling simulator and a driving simulator.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: By designing and evaluating safer environments for cyclists, this study will identify solutions that reduce the risk of road trauma and importantly, support this alternative mode of transport and thereby contribute to a reduction in traffic-related emissions and pollution and enhance sustainable economic and social connectivity.},

abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) is gaining wide popularity as a means to reduce urban stormwater runoff. The challenges to long-term success of many GI policies, however, depend on citizen understanding and willingness to be engaged in the process of GI implementation. In this study, we developed a conceptual model that incorporated human preferences and biophysical processes in a coupled manner to estimate stormwater runoff variation at the sewershed scale under different acceptable GI implementation scenarios. To investigate resident receptivity toward GI implementation, we conducted surveys in selected Syracuse sewersheds and developed the scenario of residents implementing rain barrels and rain gardens in their private properties based on the survey results. We simulated this scenario at the lot level using the model we developed within the framework of the EPA SWMM5 model to estimate reductions in peak flow and total runoff volume for major storm events. With our model, we also tested the effect of planned government tree planting scenarios. The scenario simulations were applied in three urban sewersheds of varying socio-economic and biophysical structures in the City of Syracuse, New York. The simula- tion results indicated that both the “government participation” and “household participation” scenarios, compared to pre-GI-development conditions, would contribute to a modest reduction in stormwater peak flow ({\textgreater}4 {\%}) and total runoff volume ({\textgreater}5 {\%}) across the simulated sewersheds. This study provides decision makers with a scientific methodology to quantify how human decisions can shape ecosystem function, and thus support sustain- able stormwater management planning while addressing citizen preferences and needs.

The objective of this experiment was to obtain equations to predict direct beam and diffuse irradiance in both the visible (PAR) and near-infrared wave bands from measurements of only the total incoming solar radiation. Relationships for potential values of direct and diffuse, visible and near-infrared radiation were established from "clear day" experimental data. Estimates of total visible (PAR) and near-infrared radiation were made by partitioning the measurement of solar radiation using estimates of potential visible and potential near-infrared radiation. Estimates of direct components in the visible and near-infrared were made with relationships developed from the experimental data. There was good agreement between predicted and measured values of the various components of solar radiation. In addition, a correction term for the measurement of diffuse solar radiation with a silicon cell pyranometer was developed. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {In this paper regional (synoptic) and large-scale climate drivers of rainfall are investigated for Victoria, Australia. A non-linear classification methodology known as self-organizing maps (SOM) is used to identify 20 key regional synoptic patterns, which are shown to capture a range of significant synoptic features known to influence the climate of the region. Rainfall distributions are assigned to each of the 20 patterns for nine rainfall stations located across Victoria, resulting in a clear distinction between wet and dry synoptic types at each station. The influence of large-scale climate modes on the frequency and timing of the regional synoptic patterns is also investigated. This analysis revealed that phase changes in the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and/or the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are associated with a shift in the relative frequency of wet and dry synoptic types on an annual to interannual timescale. In addition, the relative frequency of synoptic types is shown to vary on a multi-decadal timescale, associated with changes in the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Importantly, these results highlight the potential to utilise the link between the regional synoptic patterns derived in this study and large-scale climate modes to improve rainfall forecasting for Victoria, both in the short- (i.e. seasonal) and long-term (i.e. decadal/multi-decadal scale). In addition, the regional and large-scale climate drivers identified in this study provide a benchmark by which the performance of Global Climate Models (GCMs) may be assessed.

abstract = {This study describes the methodology and results for calculating future global aviation emissions of carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from air traffic under four of the IPCC/SRES (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change/Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) marker scenarios: A1B, A2, B1, and B2. In addition, a mitigation scenario has been calculated for the B1 scenario, requiring rapid and significant technology development and transition. A global model of aircraft movements and emissions (FAST) was used to calculate fuel use and emissions to 2050 with a further outlook to 2100. The aviation emission scenarios presented are designed to interpret the SRES and have been developed to aid in the quantification of the climate change impacts of aviation. Demand projections are made for each scenario, determined by SRES economic growth factors and the SRES storylines. Technology trends are examined in detail and developed for each scenario providing plausible projections for fuel efficiency and emissions control technology appropriate to the individual SRES storylines.

abstract = {The interactions between the structure of a city and the atmosphere have an impact on thermal comfort, air quality and building energy consumption for space heating and cooling. A mesoscale model, with a multilayer urban canopy parameterization, coupled with a simple building energy model is used to investigate such interactions by simulating 22 idealized cities in 3D with the same total population, but different population densities and vegetation fraction in the urban areas. Simulations are performed for summer and winter periods at mid latitude and for a hot dry climate. Results indicate that compact cities, with buildings with low surface-to-volume ratios, minimize the building energy consumption for space heating/cooling, but maximize the outdoor heat stress. For air quality, the optimum is for cities with intermediate population densities. The inclusion of vegetation is most of the time positive, and never detrimental, in this climate.},

@article{Ryu2011a,
abstract = {A new single-layer urban canopy model for use in mesoscale atmospheric models is developed and validated. The urban canopy model represents a built-up area as a street canyon, two facing buildings, and a road. In this model, the two facing walls are divided into sunlit and shaded walls on the basis of solar azimuth angle and canyon orientation, and individual surface temperature and energy budget are calculated for each wall. In addition, for better estimation of turbulent energy exchange within the canyon, a computational fluid dynamics model is employed to incorporate the effects of canyon aspect ratio (height-to-width ratio) and reference wind direction on canyon wind speed. The model contains the essential physical processes occurring in an urban canopy: absorption and reflection of shortwave and longwave radiation, exchanges of turbulent energy and water between surfaces (roof, two facing walls, and road) and adjacent air, and heat transfer by conduction through substrates. The developed urban canopy model is validated using datasets obtained at two urban sites: Marseille, France, and Basel, Switzerland. The model satisfactorily reproduces canyon air temperatures, surface temperatures, net radiation, sensible heat fluxes, latent heat fluxes, and storage heat fluxes for both sites. Extensive experiments are conducted to examine the sensitivities of the urban surface energy balance to meteorological factors and urban surface parameters. The reference wind speed is found to be a more crucial meteorological factor than the reference air temperature in altering urban surface energy balance, especially for weak winds. The urban surface energy balance is most sensitive to the roof albedo among urban surface parameters. The roof fraction, canyon aspect ratio, and ratio of roughness length for momentum to that for heat for the roof play important roles in altering urban surface energy balance.},

@article{Wilson2000,
abstract = {The components of the surface energy balance were measured for 3 years over a broadleaved deciduous forest using the eddy covariance technique. Within years, the magnitude and distribution of fluxes was controlled by seasonal changes in solar radiation, drought, as well as leaf emergence and senescence. Evapotranspiration increased by a factor greater than five (from about 0.5 to 3 mm day-1) after leaves emerged in spring. Large decreases in sensible heat flux were observed over the same period (6 to 2 MJ day-1) despite increases in solar radiation. The most influential effect on annual fluxes was the occurrence and extent of drought, with lesser control exerted by differences in the timing of leaf expansion and leaf senescence. Average annual evapotranspiration over the period was 567 mm and ranged from 537 to 611 mm. The year with the lowest precipitation, soil moisture content and surface conductance also had the lowest evapotranspiration. Although evapotranspiration was quite sensitive to surface conductance and surface conductance was reduced substantially by drought, the correlation of low surface conductance and high humidity deficit reduced the effects of drought on evapotranspiration. Differences in net radiation among years were only a minor source of variability in evapotranspiration. In addition to surface conductance, other bulk parameters are calculated to describe the general exchange characteristics of this forest. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {AbstractUrban and neighbourhood design can moderate the effects of building design on human behaviour and well-being, and vice versa. The interdependence between built environments across scales is critical yet is often poorly understood. This paper overviews several psychological processes linking human behaviour to environmental design, both inside and out. In particular, the paper focuses on two environmental stressors ? crowding and noise ? in four daily indoor environments: residential, school, work and commuting. These two stressors are often linked and can adversely impact people if improperly designed. Moreover, urban and neighbourhood design can mitigate such negative effects. Key suggestions for practitioners and policy makers include proper acoustic design, easily accessible semi-public or outdoor places and walkable streets. Some illustrations of the nexus between neighbourhood and building design show that the tendency of research traditions in environment and behaviour to focus on one scale of environmental design probably misses important human-environment transactions.},

@article{Ambrosini2014,
abstract = {Urban morphology and increasing building density play a key role in the overall use of energy and promotion of environmental sustainability. The urban environment causes a local increase of temperature, a phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). The purpose of this work is the study of the possible formation of an UHI and the evaluation of its magnitude, in the context of a small city, carried out with the ENVI-met{\textregistered} software. For this purpose, a simulation was needed, and this simulation is preparatory for a monitoring campaign on site, which will be held in the immediate future. ENVI-met{\textregistered} simulates the temporal evolution of several thermodynamics parameters on a micro-scale range, creating a 3D, non-hydrostatic model of the interactions between building-atmosphere-vegetation. The weather conditions applied simulate a typical Italian summer heat wave. Three different case-studies have been analyzed: Base Case, Cool Case and Green Case. Analysis of the actual state in the Base Case shows how even in an area with average building density, such as the old town center of a small city, fully developed UHI may rise with strong thermal gradients between built areas and open zones with plenty of vegetation. These gradients arise in a really tiny space (few hundreds of meters), showing that the influence of urban geometry can be decisive in the characterization of local microclimate. Simulations, carried out considering the application of green or cool roofs, showed small relevant effects as they become evident only in large areas heavily built up (metropolis) subject to more intense climate conditions.},

@article{Tan2015,
abstract = {Implementation of urban greenery is a widely adopted mitigation strategy to reducing the Urban Heat Island effect. Many studies have shown that urban greenery is effective in reducing ambient temperature (ta) and surface temperature (ts). However, there are limited studies on the effect of rooftop greenery on the reduction of mean radiant temperature (tmrt).This study focuses on quantifying the effects of plant evapotranspiration rate (ET) and shrub albedo (SA) on tmrt in a rooftop garden setting. Field measurement was conducted for three plots of rooftop greenery setup at the roof of School of Design and Environment in the National University of Singapore from May 2014 to December 2014.Data collected shows that tmrt, ta, and ts above the rooftop garden canopy are generally lower than above the concrete roof. 525 data points were used for regression modeling of ET, SA and tmrt. An R2 of 0.851 was achieved, highlighting strong correlation between variables. The tmrt prediction model was validated with 150 data points and was able to estimate tmrt with sufficient accuracy. Sensitivity analysis provides the range of ET and SA required to achieve the desired tmrt reduction. A plant selection chart derived from the tmrt prediction model can be used for selecting plants for maximum cooling potential.},

abstract = {Environmental child-friendliness is affected by how built environments and green spaces are planned and designed, but also by their ongoing management, including both development and maintenance. This study examined children's perspectives on their local environments with focus on green spaces and their management in an urban village. Five groups totalling 16 children aged 10-11 were interviewed through child-led walks. Both the qualities of the village as a whole and of specific places within it added to the child-friendliness of the local environment. The children showed planned and managed spaces including playgrounds and parks, and unmanaged places such as abandoned gardens. They found many qualities in multifunctional planned places with a varied, rich content. In unmanaged areas the lack of management was seen as positive for exploration, play possibilities and for the place to be children's own. The findings suggest that children's perspectives can play an important role not only in planning and design, but also in the ongoing process of landscape management, including the provision of more variation in local green spaces.},

abstract = {Vegetation and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating thermal load in urban areas. The goals of this study were to analyse species-specific microclimatic effects and to identify the role of leaf-area-density, transpiration, and stomatal conductance for cooling effects at urban sites. Air temperature, relative humidity and surface temperature were used to study the effects of six tree species with similar age structure in a residential area with comparable site conditions. Transpiration, stomatal conductance and leaf-area density were measured during the summer months in 2013. Air temperatures and relative humidity were monitored for four trees per street in hourly intervals, and surface temperatures were recorded in the afternoon for three hot days on the shaded and unshaded asphalt surfaces beneath the trees. Species differ significantly in their ability to reduce air and surface temperatures, as well as to increase relative humidity. Trees showing both a high leaf-area density and a high rate of transpiration are more effective in cooling the air temperatures. Differences in the surface temperatures of the tree shaded areas are more pronounced compared to the air temperatures. Thus, the surface temperatures of the full sun exposed areas are up to 15.2K warmer than that in the tree shaded areas. The results provide information to decrease thermal load in urban areas for future tree planting by choosing species with high cooling potential. The highest cooling potential was measured for Corylus colurna and Tilia cordata ‘Greenspire' and the lowest for Ulmus × hollandica ‘Lobel'.},

@article{Green1993,
abstract = {The radiation balance of an isolated walnut tree was measured using an experimental Whirligig device. The total amount of all-wave radiation absorbed by the tree canopy was used to estimate transpiration rates using a Penman-Monteith model. The results compared favourably with tree water use, measured by the heat-pulse technique. The total amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by the tree canopy was combined with a photosynthetic light response curve to estimate net photosynthesis rates. The results compare favourably with published data from other tree canopies. Daily energy balance calculations showed that on average, about two-thirds of the total radiant energy absorbed by the tree canopy was dissipated as latent heat in the form of transpiration. The dominant environmental variable influencing transpiration was the vapour pressure deficit of the air. Almost two-thirds of the net latent heat flux was attributable to the vapour pressure deficit component, with the remainder owing to the radiation component. Daily transpiration-assimilation ratios varied from day to day in response to changing environmental conditions, but generally decreased with increasing net photosynthesis and with increasing transpiration. This appears to be the first time that such a direct measurement of the energy balance and photosynthesis of a single tree has been made.},

It examines the discursive convergences and conflicts between practices of consumption and notions of addiction, which it notes are consistently represented in terms of the oppositional categories of self-control vs. compulsion and freedom vs. determinism. These interrelations are explored with reference to the development of notions of addiction, and their relation to shifting configurations of identity, subjectivity and governance. Finally, it suggests that the notion of 'addiction' has particular valence in advanced liberal societies, where an unprecedented emphasis on the values of freedom, autonomy and choice not only encourage the conditions for its proliferation into ever wider areas of social life, but also reveal deep tensions within the ideology of consumerism itself.},

@article{Alexander2016,
abstract = {There are a number of models available for examining the interaction between cities and the atmosphere over a range of scales, from small scales - such as individual facades, buildings, neighbourhoods - to the effect of the entire conurbation itself. Many of these models require detailed morphological characteristics and material properties along with relevant meteorological data to be initialised. However, these data are difficult to obtain given the heterogeneity of built forms, particularly in newly emerging cities. Yet, the need for models which can be applied to urban areas (for instance to address planning problems) is increasingly urgent as the global population becomes more urban. In this paper, a modeling approach which derives the required land cover parameters for a mid-complex urban energy budget and water budget model (SUEWS) in a consistent manner is evaluated in four cities (Dublin, Hamburg, Melbourne and Phoenix). The required parameters for the SUEWS model are derived using local climate zones (LCZs) for land cover, and meteorological observations from off-site synoptic stations. More detailed land cover and meteorological data are then added to the model in stages to examine the impact on model performance with respect to observations of turbulent fluxes of sensible (QH) and latent (QE) heat. Replacing LCZ land cover with detailed fractional coverages was shown to marginally improve model performance, however the performance of model coupled with ???coarse??? LCZ data was within the same range of error (20???40??W??m?????2 for QE and 40???60??W??m?????2 for QH) as high resolution data.},

@article{Robinson1996,
abstract = {The first year of the mandatory bicycle helmet laws in Australia saw increased helmet wearing from 31{\%} to 75{\%} of cyclists in Victoria and from 31{\%} of children and 26{\%} of adults in New South Wales (NSW) to 76{\%} and 85{\%}. However, the two major surveys using matched before and after samples in Melbourne (Finch et al. 1993; Report No. 45, Monash Univ. Accident Research Centre) and throughout NSW (Smith and Milthorpe 1993; Roads and Traffic Authority) observed reductions in numbers of child cyclists 15 and 2.2 times greater than the increase in numbers of children wearing helmets. This suggests the greatest effect of the helmet law was not to encourage cyclists to wear helmets, but to discourage cycling. In contrast, despite increases to at least 75{\%} helmet wearing, the proportion of head injuries in cyclists admitted or treated at hospital declined by an average of only 13{\%}. The percentage of cyclists with head injuries after collisions with motor vehicles in Victoria declined by more, but the proportion of head injured pedestrians also declined; the two followed a very similar trend. These trends may have been caused by major road safety initiatives introduced at the same time as the helmet law and directed at both speeding and drink-driving. The initiatives seem to have been remarkably effective in reducing road trauma for all road users, perhaps affecting the proportions of victims suffering head injuries as well as total injuries. The benefits of cycling, even without a helmet, have been estimated to outweigh the hazards by a factor of 20 to 1 (Hillman 1993. Cycle helmets-the case for and against. Policy Studies Institute, London). Consequently, a helmet law, whose most notable effect was to reduce cycling, may have generated a net loss of health benefits to the nation. Despite the risk of dying from head injury per hour being similar for unhelmeted cyclists and motor vehicle occupants, cyclists alone have been required to wear head protection. Helmets for motor vehicle occupants are now being marketed and a mandatory helmet law for these road users has the potential to save 17 times as many people from death by head injury as a helmet law for cyclists without the adverse effects of discouraging a healthy and pollution free mode of transport.},

abstract = {Despite the potential to provide new insight into the underlying heterogeneity of urban thermal landscapes, local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) remains underutilized in land surface temperature (LST) related study. The present research applies local Moran's I as a unique approach to recognize the pattern of statistically significant LST increase by detecting clusters of localized hot spots. The single channel algorithm has been applied to extract LST from nine temporal Landsat datasets ranging from 2001 to 2013. LST difference maps generated with 2001 as the base year have been filtered by local Moran's I at four different spatial weights (90 m, 120 m, 150 m and 200 m) to represent a spatially homogeneous form of LST clusters. Smaller spatial weights are useful to map more localized and specific pattern of urban LST change, whereas larger spatial weights produce a somewhat generalized pattern, useful for studying the coarse scale phenomenon. Integrating LISA clusters to the temperature-vegetation (TVX) feature space validates the hot spots as areas with significant land use transformations in the last decade. Further, the spatial sector-wise concentration of hot spots throughout the time series determines the direction and magnitude of urban expansion. The study provides innovative insights on how the integrated application of local Moran's I on LST change and TVX can be used to delineate the regions of acute land transformation and, in turn, act as a decision-making tool for urban planning.},

abstract = {Neighborhood urban parks are easily available settings for seniors to engage in walking. Park pathway characteristics can promote or limit senior walking. The present study examines how four objective measurements of pathway configurational characteristics relate to senior walking in two neighborhood parks in Beijing, China. In total, 75 pathway segments were included in the study. Senior walking behavior was measured through on-site observations, and sum of observed seniors on each pathway segment was the dependent variable. Space syntax approach was used to measure four park pathway configurational characteristics, i.e., average depth to gates, average depth to landmarks, control value, and global integration. In addition, three micro-level pathway characteristics were also included: pathway connection with activity zones, presence of shade, and lateral visibility. Regression analysis indicates that pathway global integration value (degree of syntactic accessibility) and control value (degree of control on accessing neighboring pathways) are positively associated with number of observed seniors on each pathway segment. Moreover, pathways without connection with activity zones are used more by seniors. In design practice, we can distribute preferred micro-level design characteristics, such as shade and benches along pathways with high global integration value and control value, in order to encourage senior walking.},

abstract = {Cities concentrate risks and the adverse effects of dense populations, such as outdoor air pollution, chronic disease and the impact of extreme weather events. Governments and planning bodies struggle to heed and apply the abundance of unintegrated research that links aspects of the urban environment with urban residents' wellbeing. In order to promote human wellbeing in cities, a number of key features of the urban environment should be promoted. The medical science, urban ecology and urban design research already recognises the importance of some aspects, including providing walkable spaces, community space and greenspace. We argue that in practice, the provision of these three features is insufficient for human wellbeing. Emerging research demonstrates the importance of biodiversity and eco-system functions to wellbeing. This paper outlines the concept of wellbeing and provides a summary of the three established features of urban environments that enhance residents' lives: the provision of walkable, community and greenspace. We then outline the importance of two vital but often overlooked links in the discussion of how urban planning contributes to wellbeing: biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Until governments and policies recognise the importance of these two elements, urban design and management for wellbeing is at best simplistic. It is important for biodiversity and ecosystem function to be considered during the design decision process. Urban designers and ecologists should recognise that their work has the potential to contribute to human wellbeing by integrating biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in their research. Cities are human-dominated environments and as such, the presence and persistence of nature is dependent upon urban residents (Rees 1997). The human-nature relationship is symbiotic because urban nature is not just reliant on the residents of cities, but evidence suggests that human wellbeing is associated with the presence of nature. This symbiosis is rarely recognised by the governments, planning bodies and residents of cities.

abstract = {A simple heat alert system, based solely on predicted maximum and minimum daily temperatures, has been developed for the city of Melbourne in southeast Australia. The system is based upon a demonstration that, when mean daily temperature exceeds a threshold of 30 degrees C (mean of today's maximum temperature and tonight's minimum temperature), the average daily mortality of people aged 65 years or more is about 15-17{\%} greater than usual. Similar numbers of excess deaths also occur when daily minimum temperatures exceed 24 degrees C (increases of 19-21{\%} over expected death rate), so a heat alert system based solely on this widely available weather forecast variable is also feasible. No strong signal of excess heat-related deaths appears when the data are stratified using daily maximum temperatures. This may be because in Melbourne some days with very high maximum temperatures will be affected by the passage of cool changes and cold fronts in the afternoon, leading to a rapid drop in temperature (i.e., some days with high maximum temperatures will not continue to be hot throughout the day and into the evening). A single day with temperatures exceeding the thresholds noted above is sufficient to cause this increase in mortality, rather than requiring an extended heat wave. The increased daily mortality does not appear to represent a short-term advancement of mortality.},

abstract = {A microscale three-dimensional (3-D) urban energy balance model, Temperatures$\backslash$nof Urban Facets in 3-D (TUF-3D), is developed to predict urban surface$\backslash$ntemperatures for a variety of surface geometries and properties,$\backslash$nweather conditions, and solar angles. The surface is composed of$\backslash$nplane-parallel facets: roofs, walls, and streets, which are further$\backslash$nsub-divided into identical square patches, resulting in a 3-D raster-type$\backslash$nmodel geometry. The model code is structured into radiation, conduction$\backslash$nand convection sub-models. The radiation sub-model uses the radiosity$\backslash$napproach and accounts for multiple reflections and shading of direct$\backslash$nsolar radiation. Conduction is solved by finite differencing of the$\backslash$nheat conduction equation, and convection is modelled by empirically$\backslash$nrelating patch heat transfer coefficients to the momentum forcing$\backslash$nand the building morphology. The radiation and conduction sub-models$\backslash$nare tested individually against measurements, and the complete model$\backslash$nis tested against full-scale urban surface temperature and energy$\backslash$nbalance observations. Modelled surface temperatures perform well$\backslash$nat both the facet-average and the sub-facet scales given the precision$\backslash$nof the observations and the uncertainties in the model inputs. The$\backslash$nmodel has several potential applications, such as the calculation$\backslash$nof radiative loads, and the investigation of effective thermal anisotropy$\backslash$n(when combined with a sensor-view model).},

@article{Masson2014,
abstract = {Societies have to both reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and undertake adaptation measures to limit the negative impacts of global warming on the population, the economy and the environment. Examining how best to adapt cities is especially challenging as urban areas will evolve as the climate changes. Thus, examining adaptation strategies for cities requires a strong interdisciplinary approach involving urban planners, architects, meteorologists, building engineers, economists, and social scientists. Here we introduce a systemic modelling approach to the problem.Our four-step methodology consists of: first, defining interdisciplinary scenarios; second, simulating the long-term evolution of cities on the basis of socio-economic and land-use models; third, calculating impacts with physical models (such as TEB), and; finally, calculating the indicators that quantify the effect of different adaptation policies. In the examples presented here, urban planning strategies are shown to have unexpected influence on city expansion in the long term. Moreover, the Urban Heat Island should be taken into account in operational estimations of building energy demands. Citizens' practices seem to be an efficient lever for reducing energy consumption in buildings.Interdisciplinary systemic modelling appears well suited to the evaluation of several adaptation strategies for a very broad range of topics.},

abstract = {Te evaluation of the effectiveness of countermeasures for a reduction of urban heat stress, such as fac ¸ade greening, is challenging due to lacking transferability of results from one location to another. Furthermore, complex variables such as the mean radiant temperature (푇mrt) are necessary to assess outdoor human bioclimate. We observed 푇mrt in front of a building fac ¸ade in Berlin, Germany, which is half-greened while the other part is bare. 푇mrt was reduced (mean 2K) in front of the greened compared to the bare fac ¸ade. To overcome observational shortcomings, we applied the microscalemodels ENVI-met, RayMan, and SOLWEIG.We evaluated these models based on observations. Our results show that 푇mrt (MD = −1.93K) and downward short-wave radiation (MD = 14.39W/m2) were sufficiently simulated in contrast to upward short-wave and long-wave radiation. Finally, we compare the simulated reduction of 푇mrt with the observed one in front of the fac ¸ade greening, showing that the models were not able to simulate the effects of fac ¸ade greening with the applied settings. Our results reveal that fac ¸ade greening contributes only slightly to a reduction of heat stress in front of building fac ¸ades. 1.},

abstract = {The gap between point measurements made during a measurement campaign and the required discrete data of human thermal comfort in the form of maps could be overcome by statistical or numerical models. City planners usually demand thermal maps with a resolution below 50 m. The required input data for the statistical models were meteorological data at high resolution as well as land use and land cover data including morphological data. Meteorological data were obtained through car traverses on a measuring campaign on hot summer days in July 2014. The chosen statistical approaches of stepwise multiple linear regression and artificial neural network were compared for the case study area Stuttgart, Germany. The Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) was applied to analyse the human thermal conditions taking into account both the meteorological environment and the thermo-physiological parameters including the human energy balance. The polycentric and complex spatial distribution of heat stress and heat load is clearly visible in the created maps. One hot spot is the city centre and its surrounding residential neighbourhood, the other hot spot can be detected in Bad Cannstatt (easterly of the Neckar river valley), including industrial and residential areas. Thereby, the non-linear artificial neural network model delivers better results than the stepwise multiple linear regression model. Advantages of the artificial neural network arise from the possibility to reveal non-linear dependencies and interactions between the variables resulting in a better model fit.},

We investigated the association between the emerald ash borer (EAB)???an invasive tree pest first discovered in the US in 2002???and crime in Cincinnati, Ohio. We used a natural experimental approach, and compared crime (in 11 classes) on census block groups infested with EAB with crime on block groups not infested with EAB between 2005 and 2014. We accounted for demographic and biological differences between infested and un-infested block groups using propensity-score weighting. EAB infestation was significantly and positively associated with relative increases in crime in all but four crime categories. Our results suggest that invasive tree pests may be associated with social costs worth considering when managing invasive species. By extension, healthy trees may provide significant social benefits.},

abstract = {As cities continue to grow and develop under climate change, identifying and assessing practical approaches to mitigate high urban temperatures is critical to help provide thermally comfortable, attractive and sustainable urban environments. Green and cool roofs are commonly reported to provide urban heat mitigation potential; however, their performance is highly dependent upon their design, particularly green roofs that vary in substrate depth, vegetation species, and watering regime. This study compares the insulating properties, the radiation budget and surface energy balance of four experimental rooftops, including a green roof (extensive green roof planted with Sedum) and a cool roof (uninsulated rooftop coated with white elastomeric paint), over the summer of 2011-12 in Melbourne, Australia. For the roof treatments explored here, results suggest that cool roofs, combined with insulation, provide the greatest overall benefit in terms of urban heat mitigation and energy transfer into buildings. The high albedo of the cool roof substantially reduced net radiation, leaving less energy available at the surface for sensible heating during the day. Under warm and sunny conditions, when soil moisture was limited, evapotranspiration from the green roof was low, leading to high sensible heat fluxes during the day. Irrigation improved the performance of the green roof by increasing evapotranspiration. Daytime Bowen ratios decreased from above four during dry conditions, to less than one after irrigation, yet sensible heat fluxes were still higher than for the cool roof. These results demonstrate that rooftops must be designed accordingly to target specific performance objectives, such as heat mitigation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Wang2011a,
abstract = {Single-layer physically based urban canopy models (UCM) have gained popularity for modeling urban– atmosphere interactions, especially the energy transport component. For a UCM to capture the physics of conductive, radiative, and turbulent advective transport of energy, it is important to provide it with an accurate parameter space, including both mesoscale meteorological forcing and microscale surface inputs. While field measurement of all input parameters to a UCM is rarely possible, understanding the model sensitivity to individual parameters is essential to determine the relative importance of parameter uncertainty for model performance. In this paper, an advanced Monte Carlo approach—namely, subset simulation—is used to quantify the impact of the uncertainty of surface input parameters on the output of an offline modified version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-UCM. On the basis of the conditional sampling technique, the importance of surface parameters is determined in terms of their impact on critical model responses. It is found that model outputs (both critical energy fluxes and surface temperatures) are highly sensitive to uncertainties in urban geometry, whereas variations in emissivities and building interior temperatures are relatively insignificant. In addition, the sensitivity of the model to input surface parameters is also shown to be very weakly dependent on meteorological parameters. The statistical quantification of the model's sensitivity to input parameters has practical implications, such as surface parameter calibrations in UCM and guidance for urban heat island mitigation strategies},

abstract = {In recent years high-resolution numerical simulation of surface-plant-air interactions as an important part of global circulation models (GCM) or as a tool to assist in planning decisions has experienced increased consideration. In contrast large scale phenomena described in GCMs, the lower part of the atmosphere where we live is very sensitive to small scale processes which can develop an individual local climate, different to the expected average conditions. Especially in urban areas the great variety of different surfaces and sheltering obstacles produces a pattern of distinct microclimate systems. To simulate these local effects, microscale surface-plant-air interaction schemes with a special extension to typical artificial urban boundaries are needed. The paper focuses on the microscale numerical simulation of surface-plant-air interactions inside urban structures, especially the feedback between artificial surfaces like buildings and vegetation inside street canyons, backyards or greens. The three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model ENVI-met is presented and used to solve the basic equations forward in time and can simulate 'hard' wind field modifications (solid boundaries) like walls as well as 'soft' modifications (porous shelters) like vegetation. A case study of building a small park inside the CBD area will show what effects even small changes can have on local flow and temperature fields.},

@article{Sisser2016,
abstract = {As urban areas expand in population and geographic spread, residential landscapes become more pervasive, which is often associated with an increase in turfgrass that can contribute to changes in water use and nutrient flows. Management of these landscapes is influenced at multiple scales-municipal policies, individual homeowner decision-making, and neighborhood norms, and municipal policies. Most municipalities implement policies that encourage (i.e., weed and grass height ordinances) and restrict (i.e., irrigation ordinances) lawn management. But what is the relationship between yard ordinances, homeowner awareness of these ordinances, and neighborhood yard norms? We explored this question through homeowner interviews and a review of yard ordinances in 17 cities in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area as well as interviews with code enforcement officers. We found most municipalities have lawn irrigation restrictions and weed or grass height ordinances, yet generally rely on complaints from neighbors to enforce these lawn management policies. This may be helpful when it comes to policies reinforcing agreed upon social norms-like grass height ordinances-but may be difficult with policies acting against the norm-like lawn irrigation restrictions. Additionally, homeowners in suburban areas posted high rates of awareness of local policies. Homeowner comments suggest social norms regarding lawn management are present across the urban gradient; weed-free and mowed lawns were most commonly identified. These findings have implications for policy development moving forward as cities face issues related to water scarcity or try to accommodate changing resident desires for natural landscaping.},

abstract = {Land surface energy balance in a built environment is widely modelled using urban canopy models with representation of building arrays as big street canyons. Modification of this simplified geometric representation, however, leads to challenging numerical difficulties in improving physical parameterization schemes that are deterministic in nature. In this paper, we develop a stochastic algorithm to estimate view factors between canyon facets in the presence of shade trees based on Monte Carlo simulation, where an analytical formulation is inhibited by the complex geometry. The model is validated against analytical solutions of benchmark radiative problems as well as field measurements in real street canyons. In conjunction with the matrix method resolving infinite number of reflections, the proposed model is capable of predicting the radiative exchange inside the street canyon with good accuracy. Modeling of transient evolution of thermal filed inside the street canyon using the proposed method demonstrate the potential of shade trees in mitigating canyon surface temperatures as well as saving of building energy use. This new numerical framework also deepens our insight into the fundamental physics of radiative heat transfer and surface energy balance for urban climate modeling.},

@article{Lacan2015,
abstract = {Following the April 26, 1986, accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (Ukraine), the nearby city of Pripyat was contaminated and then quickly abandoned with its urban trees largely intact, resulting in a unique "city forest" that has remained un-maintained for over one-quarter of a century. We assessed the composition and condition of city trees in Pripyat, and documented the process of ecological succession in an attempt to predict the future urban forest, by surveying trees on 40 plots distributed across 4 urban tree habitats (street-side, tree grove, lawn, and pavement). The plots contained 20 species of trees, and were dominated by the seedling age-class, with as many as 8980 Acer platanoides seedlings/ha. Among the urban habitats, street-side and tree grove plots had the highest density of regenerating trees. Regeneration varied by species, with some (e.g., Populus nigra 'Italica') regenerating in every plot where mature trees were present, while others (e.g., Aesculus hipocastaneum) not regenerating at all. Based on the regeneration patterns and tree species characteristics, we expect the future urban forest of Pripyat to contain a mosaic of oak/maple areas (street-side, grove, and lawn habitats) with poplar/aspen areas on the pavement habitat. Condition of mature trees was good in over 50{\%} of surveyed trees, while the rest exhibited the defects common to other urban trees (e.g., co-dominant stems), but also displayed characteristics generally absent from trees in other cities (e.g., very high live crown ratios). In its current age-distribution, species composition, and condition of its urban trees, Pripyat demonstrates the ongoing change from the primacy of anthropogenic factors (e.g., trees selected for ornamental characteristics) to ecological ones (e.g., shade tolerance) in shaping the composition and condition of an abandoned urban forest.},

abstract = {We present the formulation, calibration and validation of a model to estimate photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by olive (Olea europaea L.) canopies. The model calculates the PAR transmittance at any point located within the four central trees of the orchard. The spatial and time integration of this process allows calculation of PAR transmitted to the ground and, thus, the PAR intercepted at any given time. Direct-beam radiation, diffuse radiation and scattering are separately taken into account. Model parameters are the G-function, leaf reflectance and transmittance. Leaf inclination distributions, measured in the field, were used to derive the G-function. A planophile distribution was found. Leaf reflectances measured in three olive cultivars were, on average, 0.06 for adaxial and 0.12 for abaxial surfaces, while leaf transmittance was below 0.01. The model was barely sensitive to the parameters. Predictions of diffuse and total transmittance were tested on clear and overcast days in winter, fall and summer at Cordoba, Spain, in seven olive orchards of quite different characteristics. The validation showed that when estimating average canopy values, local errors compensate and the predictions of intercepted PAR seem correct for all canopy types, sun position and heights within the stand. The procedure seems applicable to any olive tree variety and does not present important systematic errors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The MITgcm is a state-of-the-art general circulation model for simulating the ocean and the atmosphere. This model is fully three dimensional (including the non-hydrostatic term of momentum equations) and includes a finite-volume discretization and a number of additional features enabling simulations from global ({\textless}i{\textgreater}O{\textless}/i{\textgreater}(10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}7{\textless}/sup{\textgreater})m) to local scales ({\textless}i{\textgreater}O{\textless}/i{\textgreater}(100)m). The BFM is a complex biogeochemical model that simulates the cycling of a number of constituents and nutrients within marine ecosystems. The coupler presented in this paper links the two models through an efficient scheme that manages communication and memory sharing between the models. We also test specific model options to balance the numerical accuracy against the computational performance. The coupling scheme allows us to solve several processes that are not considered by each of the models alone, including light attenuation parameterizations along the water column, phytoplankton and detritus sinking, external inputs, and surface and bottom fluxes. Moreover, this new coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model has been configured and tested against an idealized problem (a cyclonic gyre in a mid-latitude closed basin) and a realistic case study (central part of the Mediterranean Sea in 2006{\&}ndash;2012). The numerical results are consistent with the expected theoretical and observed behaviour of both the idealized system and the Mediterranean domain, thus demonstrating the applicability of the new coupled model to a wide range of ocean biogeochemistry problems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Features of the built environment that may influence physical activity (PA) levels are commonly captured using a so-called walkability index. Since such indices typically describe opportunities for walking in everyday life of adults, they might not be applicable to assess urban opportunities for PA in children. Particularly, the spatial availability of recreational facilities may have an impact on PA in children and should be additionally considered. We linked individual data of 400 2- to 9-year-old children recruited in the European IDEFICS study to geographic data of one German study region, based on individual network-dependent neighborhoods. Environmental features of the walkability concept and the availability of recreational facilities, i.e. playgrounds, green spaces, and parks, were measured. Relevant features were combined to a moveability index that should capture urban opportunities for PA in children. A gamma log-regression model was used to model linear and non-linear effects of individual variables on accelerometer-based moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) stratified by pre-school children (6 years). Single environmental features and the resulting indices were separately included into the model to investigate the effect of each variable on MVPA. In school children, commonly used features such as residential density [Formula: see text], intersection density [Formula: see text], and public transit density [Formula: see text] showed a positive effect on MVPA, while land use mix revealed a negative effect on MVPA [Formula: see text]. In particular, playground density [Formula: see text] and density of public open spaces, i.e., playgrounds and parks combined [Formula: see text], showed positive effects on MVPA. However, availability of green spaces showed no effect on MVPA. Different moveability indices were constructed based on the walkability index accounting for the negative impact of land use mix. Moveability indices showed also strong effects on MVPA in school children for both components, expanded by playground density [Formula: see text] or by public open space density [Formula: see text], but no effects of urban measures and moveability indices were found in pre-school children. The final moveability indices capture relevant opportunities for PA in school children. Particularly, availability of public open spaces seems to be a strong predictor of MVPA. Future studies involving children should consider quantitative assessment of public recreational facilities in larger cities or urban sprawls in order to investigate the influence of the moveability on childhood PA in a broader sample.},

abstract = {In a densely populated section of Mexico City, an eddy covariance (EC) flux system was deployed on a tall urban tower to obtain direct measurements of CO2 emissions from an urban neighborhood located in a subtropical megacity. The measured fluxes and boundary layer conditions satisfy EC assumptions of stationarity, and cospectral analyses of the turbulence measurements exhibit the required boundary layer patterns for acceptable flux measurements. Results from a field experiment conducted during April 2003 show that the urban surface is a net source of CO2. The CO2 flux measurements showed a clear diurnal pattern, with the highest emissions during the morning (up to 1.60 mg m-2 s-1), and the lowest emissions during nighttime. The measured fluxes were closely correlated to traffic patterns in the area. The mean daily flux was 0.41 mg m-2 s-1, which is similar to that observed in European and US cities. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using ratings from an expert panel, it was possible to measure five urban design qualities in terms of physical characteristics of streets and their edges: imageability, enclosure, human scale, transparency and complexity. The operational definitions do not always comport with the qualitative definitions, and provide new insights into the nature of these urban design qualities. The immediate purpose of this study is to arm researchers with operational definitions they can use to measure the street environment and test for significant associations with walking behaviour. A validation study is currently underway in New York City. Depending on the outcome of this and other follow-up research, the ultimate purpose would be to inform urban design practice.},

@article{Shuttleworth2007,
abstract = {In the spirit of the Special Issue of HESS to which it contributes, this paper documents the origin and development of the science of natural evaporation from land surfaces over the last 30?35 years, since the symposium A View from the Watershed was held to commemorate the opening of the new Institute of Hydrology (IH) building in 1973. Important subsequent technical progress includes the ability to measure routinely the diurnal cycle of near-surface meteorological variables using automatic weather stations, and of surface energy and momentum exchanges using automated implementations of the Bowen Ratio/Energy Budget technique and the Eddy Correlation technique, along with the capability to estimate the "fetch" for which these measurements apply. These improvements have been complemented by new methods to measure the separate components of evaporation, including: the interception process using randomly relocated below-canopy gauges, transpiration fluxes from individual leaves/shoots using porometers and from plants/plant components using stem-flow gauges and soil evaporation using micro-lysimeters and soil moisture depletion methods. In recent years progress has been made in making theory-based area-average estimates of evaporation using scintillometers, and model-based area-average estimates by assembling many streams of relevant data into Land Data Assimilation Systems. Theoretical progress has been made in extending near-surface turbulence theory to accommodate the effect of the "excess" boundary layer resistance to leaf-to-air transfer of energy and mass fluxes relative to that for momentum, and to allow for observed shortcoming in stability factors in the transition layer immediately above vegetation. Controversy regarding the relative merits of multi-layer model and "big leaf" representations of whole-canopy exchanges has been resolved in favour of the latter approach. Important gaps in the theory of canopy-atmosphere interactions have been filled, including recognising the need, separately, to represent dry-canopy and wet-canopy evaporation in models and the capability to describe wet-to-dry canopy transitions as well as the ability to describe sparse vegetation canopies which only partly cover the underlying soil. There is progress in methods of estimating crop water requirements, but an important recommendation of this paper is that this progress should continue by introducing use of an effective stomatal resistance rather than crop factors. The paper draws attention to relevant theoretical insight on this issue. Progress in theoretical understanding of evaporation processes has been used in the creation of numerous Land Surface Parameterisations (LSPs), the models used to represent land-surface interaction in climate and weather forecast models, and there have been important advances in describing the behaviour of plant stomata in LSPs. A major investment over the last 25 years in conducting Large-Scale Field Experiments, the better to measure, understand and model coupled land-surface/atmosphere interactions, has resulted in improvements in the capabilities of global climate models and the ability of mesoscale meteorological models to describe the enhanced circulation resulting from different forms of land-surface heterogeneity. Progress in understanding why early equations for potential evapotranspiration can be adequate in certain conditions is reviewed. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {Features of public open space (POS) have traditionally been described using on-site direct observation, but recently, low-cost and time-efficient remote desktop auditing tools have been developed. We adapted an existing, validated desktop auditing tool (the Public Open Space Desktop Auditing Tool: POSDAT) and tested it in a pilot sample of regional and metropolitan settings in Victoria, Australia. Using Google Maps and Street View, local government webpages, the National Public Toilet Registry and spatial data, we captured POSDAT items in 171 POS across 17 suburbs, of which 9 were regional. POSDAT items such as presence of waterbirds, wildlife, grass reticulation and dog signage, were not reliably observable. Using a limited sample, the majority of POSDAT items (n??=??39) had a high intra-rater reliability score (between 80 and 100{\%}) with an average agreement of 87{\%}. We found that older and lower resolution Google Street View imagery available for some outer regional areas and the inconsistency of detail in information on local government webpages hindered a consistent assessment of POS. Thus, POSDAT, based on the spatial data applied in this study, is appropriate for use in metropolitan but not regional settings.},

In both fields, the process of prioritising actions is known as triage. Although often used implicitly by conservation managers, scientists and policymakers, triage has been misinterpreted as the process of simply deciding which assets (e.g. species, habitats) will not receive investment. As a consequence, triage is sometimes associated with a defeatist conservation ethic. However, triage is no more than the efficient allocation of conservation resources and we risk wasting scarce resources if we do not follow its basic principles.},

@article{Wang2014b,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Objectives This study investigated factors correlated with the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in bicycle-motor vehicle crashes at unsignalized intersections to develop site-specific countermeasures and interventions to improve bicycle safety. Method Crash data were extracted from accident reports entered into the Kentucky State Police's Kentucky Collision Database in 2002-2012. A partial proportional odds model was developed for data analysis. Results According to our modeling results, stop-controlled intersections, one-lane approaches, helmet usage, and lower speed limits were associated with decreased injury severity, while uncontrolled intersections, older (age{\textgreater}55) drivers and bicyclists, child (age{\textless}16) bicyclists, foggy and rainy weather, inadequate use of lights in dark conditions, and wet road surfaces were linked with increased injury severity. Conclusions Based on these results, we suggest the development of educational programs focused on the following groups: child bicyclists, older bicyclists, and older drivers. Investigating and modifying street lighting could improve bicycle safety. Implementing road diets/traffic calming methods could create a safer traffic environment. Certain traffic control strategies (e.g., stop control) could be considered for uncontrolled intersection s with high bicycle exposure, and helmet campaigns should be launched to increase helmet awareness and use. The study also suggests some interesting future research directions, including examining driver/bicyclist behaviors at uncontrolled intersections and studying the riding behaviors of child bicyclists in Kentucky.},

abstract = {Heavy-vehicle driving involves a challenging work environment and a high crash rate. We investigated the associations of sleepiness, sleep disorders, and work environment (including truck characteristics) with the risk of crashing between 2008 and 2011 in the Australian states of New South Wales and Western Australia. We conducted a case-control study of 530 heavy-vehicle drivers who had recently crashed and 517 heavy-vehicle drivers who had not. Drivers' crash histories, truck details, driving schedules, payment rates, sleep patterns, and measures of health were collected. Subjects wore a nasal flow monitor for 1 night to assess for obstructive sleep apnea. Driving schedules that included the period between midnight and 5:59 am were associated with increased likelihood of crashing (odds ratio = 3.42, 95{\%} confidence interval: 2.04, 5.74), as were having an empty load (odds ratio = 2.61, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.72, 3.97) and being a less experienced driver (odds ratio = 3.25, 95{\%} confidence interval: 2.37, 4.46). Not taking regular breaks and the lack of vehicle safety devices were also associated with increased crash risk. Despite the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea, it was not associated with the risk of a heavy-vehicle nonfatal, nonsevere crash. Scheduling of driving to avoid midnight-to-dawn driving and the use of more frequent rest breaks are likely to reduce the risk of heavy-vehicle nonfatal, nonsevere crashes by 2-3 times.},

abstract = {Heat-related deaths should be somewhat preventable. In France, some prevention measures are activated when minimum and maximum temperatures averaged over three days reach city-specific thresholds. The current thresholds were computed based on a descriptive analysis of past heat waves and on local expert judgement. We tested whether a different method would confirm these thresholds. The study was set in the six cities of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, Strasbourg and Limoges between 1973 and 2003. For each city, we estimated the excess in mortality associated with different temperature thresholds, using a generalised additive model, controlling for long-time trends, seasons and days of the week. These models were used to compute the mortality predicted by different percentiles of temperatures. The thresholds were chosen as the percentiles associated with a significant excess mortality. In all cities, there was a good correlation between current thresholds and the thresholds derived from the models, with 0°C to 3°C differences for averaged maximum temperatures. Both set of thresholds were able to anticipate the main periods of excess mortality during the summers of 1973 to 2003. A simple method relying on descriptive analysis and expert judgement is sufficient to define protective temperature thresholds and to prevent heat wave mortality. As temperatures are increasing along with the climate change and adaptation is ongoing, more research is required to understand if and when thresholds should be modified.},

Their resulting ability to produce shade, coolness, shelter, moisture and air filtration makes them flexible tools for environmental design.},

abstract = {The fate of irrigation in urban ecosystems is highly uncertain, due to uncertainties in urban ecohydrology. We compared irrigation rates, soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), stomatal conductance, and water budgets of landscape ecosystems managed with different turfgrass species and irrigation technologies. The “Typical” landscape had a cool-season fescue and was irrigated by an automatic timer. The “Alternative1” landscape had a warm-season paspalum and a “smart” soil moisture sensor-based irrigation system. The “Alternative2” landscape had a cool-season native sedge and a “smart” weather station-based drip irrigation system. ET was measured with a portable closed chamber and modeled using a Penman-Monteith approach, and the two methods agreed well. The water applied to the Alternative1 was 54 {\%} less than the water applied to the Typical landscape, and the water applied to the Alternative2 was 24 {\%} less. Soil moisture was similar in the Typical and Alternative2, while Alternative1 was drier in spring. The stomatal conductance of sedge was lower than the other two species, but its ET was not lower due to higher leaf area. Irrigation efficiencies (ET/applied irrigation) were 57 - 58 {\%}, 86 – 97 {\%}, and 78 - 80 {\%} for the Typical, Alternative1, and Alternative2 landscapes, respectively. Runoff was less than 2 {\%} in each landscape, and excess irrigation primarily drained below the root zone. Differences in irrigation efficiency between landscapes were due mainly to irrigation application, which varied more than species water use. Smart irrigation systems provided substantial water savings relative to a timer-based system, and prevented significant drainage losses. The utilization of smart sensors was more important than the choice of turfgrass species for irrigation efficiency.},

abstract = {Health studies have repeatedly used air temperature (. T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}a{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), sometimes adjusted for humidity, when analyzing the impact of weather on mortality. The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of mean radiant temperature (. T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}mrt{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) and its impact on heat related mortality. T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}mrt{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is an essential meteorological parameter that influences the thermal comfort (heat load) of humans. It is useful when assessing the impact of weather, especially heat, on people's health. T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}mrt{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is directly influenced by urban geometry and surface material, which also makes it a good measure to identify urban hot spots. The performance of models using T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}a{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}mrt{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} for daily mortality is compared for Stockholm County, Sweden. It is demonstrated that T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}mrt{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} models fit heat related mortality better than T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}a{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} models, which implies that health studies should consider using T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}mrt{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} rather than T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}a{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. The use of T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}mrt{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} models allows us to determine more accurate thresholds for increased risks of heat related mortality, and thus to better identify adverse weather conditions and heat prone urban geometries. Such information is needed to implement heat-warning systems and mitigate harmful effects of heat stress.},

abstract = {In an analysis of the French episode of heat wave in 2003, this article highlights how heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors. Unusually high temperatures, as well as socioeconomic vulnerability, along with social attenuation of hazards, in a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, led to an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke. In addition to age and gender, combinatorial factors included preexisting disease, medication, urban residence, isolation, poverty, and, probably, air pollution. Although diversely impacted or reported, many parts of Europe suffered human and other losses, such as farming and forestry through drought and fires. Summer 2003 was the hottest in Europe since 1500, very likely due in part to anthropogenic climate change. The French experience confirms research establishing that heat waves are a major mortal risk, number one among so-called natural hazards in postindustrial societies. Yet France had no policy in place, as if dangerous climate were restricted to a distant or uncertain future of climate change, or to preindustrial countries. We analyze the heat wave's profile as a strongly attenuated risk in the French context, as well as the causes and the effects of its sudden shift into amplification. Research and preparedness needs are highlighted.},

T mrt summarizes all short wave and long wave radiation fluxes reaching the human body, which can be very complex (variable in spatial and also in temporal manner) in urban settings. Thermal comfort researchers and urban planners need easy and sound methodological approaches to assess T mrt . After the basics of the T mrt calculation some of the methods suitable for obtaining T mrt also in urban environments will be presented.. Two of the discussed methods are based on instruments which measure the radiation fluxes integral (globe thermometer, pyranometer-pyrgeometer combination), and three of the methods are based on modelling the radiation environment with PC software (RayMan, ENVI-met and SOLWEIG). {\textcopyright} 2011 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

The effect of built environment on mobility in older populations, among whom environmental effects may be strongest, is the focus of a growing body of the literature. We reviewed recent research (1990-2010) that examined associations of objective measures of the built environment with mobility and disability in adults aged 60 years or older. Seventeen empirical articles were identified. The existing literature suggests that mobility is associated with higher street connectivity leading to shorter pedestrian distances, street and traffic conditions such as safety measures, and proximity to destinations such as retail establishments, parks, and green spaces. Existing research is limited by differences in exposure and outcome assessments and use of cross-sectional study designs. This research could lead to policy interventions that allow older adults to live more healthy and active lives in their communities.},

@article{Fischer2008,
abstract = {Long-living plant communities such as forests reduce their transpiration by closing and opening the leaf stomata as a common strategy to save water in dry periods. Meteorological models including vegetation should consider this mechanism to simulate realistic water transport from the plant to the atmosphere. Results of the German network project VERTIKO showed that commonly used meso-models such as Lokalmodell (German Weather Service) often overestimate evapotranspiration of vegetated surfaces during dry periods. This is, among other things, due to the insufficient plant-specific coupling between the soil water content and the physiological reactions of leaf stomata in the implemented SVAT modules. This study presents an approach to describe the above-mentioned coupling mechanism by upgrading the coupled vegetation boundary layer model HIRVAC. A stomatal reaction on soil moisture change, which is a part of HIRVAC, is parameterised in the included mechanistic photosynthesis model for C3 plants (PSN6). In the new HIRVAC version several parameters of the PSN6 model were scaled by a power function of the matrix potential to consider the stomatal reaction to changes in soil water content. This leads to an adaptation of the additional humidity source term in the basic equation of HIRVAC. As a result the humidity profiles in the canopy air, the latent heat flux and the energy balance of each canopy model layer are changed. The new parameterisation in HIRVAC was applied for the VERTIKO special observation period in May and June 2003 for vegetation parameters adapted to the Tharandter Wald Anchor Station (experimental site of the Department of Meteorology, TU Dresden). The HIRVAC modification leads to a realistic decrease in latent heat flux for dry soil conditions. Without coupling, latent heat flux increases continuously due to an increase in the atmospheric driving parameters of vapour pressure deficit (vpd) and temperature in the canopy. Despite some differences during the night the simulated and measured sensible heat flux agree very well, especially under dry soil conditions, while the correlation between measured and simulated latent heat flux is only moderate. The best agreement between simulated and measured latent heat flux was reached for the vpd and crown air temperature under moderate soil moisture conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Objective: A common concern in the use of a roundabout is providing adequately for the pedestrian. This unique roundabout layout, which introduces raised crosswalks directly at the roundabout entrance, as opposed to at a car length back, aims at improving safety and convenience for pedestrians at roundabouts. Methods: A preliminary evaluation of the layout was undertaken to establish its effectiveness in meeting study objectives. A quasi-experimental before-and-after study design was used to compare speeds on approach and immediately prior to the crossing to ascertain potential impact speed and implications for pedestrian safety. Compliance to crossing and crossing time were also compared in relation to safety and convenience outcomes. A questionnaire assessed pedestrian perception of the safety and convenience at the roundabout before and after treatment. Results: Results from this case study indicate that mean approach speeds (free speeds 30 m from crossing) reduced from 32.7 to 30.7 km/h and immediately prior to crossing, mean speeds reduced from 19.1 to 16.3 km/h. There was also a marked reduction in proportions of vehicles traveling at speeds that could elevate risk to pedestrians. Total crossing time after treatment reduced by around 4 s, and crossing compliance increased from approximately half to approximately 90 percent. Survey of pedestrians indicated positive response to the perceived safety and convenience posttreatment. Conclusions: Preliminary results of the case study suggest positive safety and convenience outcomes. Implications for pedestrian safety include less exposure to traffic and lower risk of serious injury, particularly for elderly pedestrians; convenience outcomes include shorter waiting times to cross and greater compliance to the crossing. A larger study is required to substantiate the findings.},

abstract = {In recent empirical studies on values of time and reliability, many have suggested that travelers are interested not only in travel time saving but also in reduction in travel time variability. Variability introduces uncertainty for travelers such that they do not know exactly when they will arrive at their destination. Thus, it is considered as a risk (or an added cost) to a traveler making a trip. Continuing research is reported on route choice models and the effect on travel time reliability in an uncertain environment caused by demand and supply variations. The goal is to examine what the aggregate impact of changes in variability might be on network assignment and how travelers with different risk-taking behaviors respond to these changes.},

To better communicate and value the importance of urban trees it is necessary to quantify these benefits and to understand the properties and processes that influence the magnitude of these benefits. For this we need verified and effective ways of modelling the trees in modelling software. This paper presents the results and problems encountered when trying to model trees effectively. The aim is to present our approach which was to treat the shade as a shading co-efficient on the wall. This allows for the consideration of the benefits of deciduous versus evergreen species. A modelling method to assess the effect of tree shading was developed and presented in this paper. Key words: thermal simulation, solar thermal load, modelling of tree shading.},

@article{DeRome2014,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cyclists are increasingly overrepresented in traffic crash casualties in Australia. There is evidence that better cycling infrastructure increases participation, but whether it reduces the numbers of injured cyclists is less clear. This study examined injury outcomes of crashes in different cycling environments. METHODS: Adult cyclists injured on- and off-road were recruited from emergency departments from November 2009 to May 2010 in the Australian Capital Territory. Eligible participants (n = 313/372, 84.1{\%}) were interviewed and their injury self-reports were corroborated with medical records where available. Participants who had crashed in transport-related areas (n = 202, 64.5{\%}) are the focus of this article. RESULTS: Participants had crashed in traffic (39.1{\%}), in cycle lanes (7.9{\%}), on shared paths (36.1{\%}), and on footpaths (16.8{\%}). Based on average weekly traffic counts, the crash involvement rate per 1000 cyclists was 11.8 on shared paths compared to 5.8 on cycle lanes. Over half of the participants (52.0{\%}) were injured in single-vehicle bicycle crashes. The remainder involved other road users, including motor vehicles (20.8{\%}), other bicycles (18.8{\%}), pedestrians (6.4{\%}), and animals (2.0{\%}). Pedestrians were involved in 16.4 percent of crashes on shared paths. Minor injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] 1) were sustained by 58.4 percent of cyclists, moderately severe injuries (AIS 2) were sustained by 36.1 percent of cyclists, and 5.4 percent of cyclists were seriously injured (AIS 3+). The average treatment required was 1.8 days with 7.5 days off work and cost to the cyclist of {\$}869 excluding medical treatment. Cyclists who crashed on shared paths or in traffic had higher injury severity scores (ISS; 4.4, 4.0) compared to those in cycle lanes or on footpaths (3.3, 3.4) and required more treatment days (2.8, 1.7 versus 0.0, 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Fewer cyclists were injured in on-road cycle lanes than in other cycling environments, and a high proportion of injuries were incurred on shared paths. This study highlights an urgent need to determine appropriate criteria and management strategies for paths classified as suitable for shared or segregated usage.

abstract = {Walking as an out-of-home mobility activity is recognised for its contribution to healthy and active ageing. The environment can have a powerful effect on the amount of walking activity undertaken by older people, thereby influencing their capacity to maintain their well-being and independence. This paper reports the findings from research examining the experiences of neighbourhood walking for 12 older people from six different inner-city high density suburbs, through analysis of data derived from travel diaries, individual time/space activity maps (created via global positioning systems (GPS) tracking over a seven-day period and geographic information system (GIS) technology), and in-depth interviews. Reliance on motor vehicles, the competing interests of pedestrians and cyclists on shared pathways and problems associated with transit systems, public transport, and pedestrian infrastructure emerged as key barriers to older people venturing out of home on foot. GPS and GIS technology provide new opportunities for furthering understanding of the out-of-home mobility of older populations. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

@article{Defraeye2012,
abstract = {Knowledge of the convective heat and mass exchange of horticultural products and other plant organs (e.g., leaves) with the environment is of interest for several pre- and postharvest technologies and for plant microclimate analysis. Although these exchange processes often occur at the microscale (e.g. at lenticels, cracks, droplets or stomata, 10 
                        -4 to 10 
                        -2m), they are still often assessed on a macroscale level. In this study, the convective passive scalar (i.e., heat) transfer from a single spherical product is investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). For this purpose, the product is placed in a virtual wind-tunnel environment, thus not in its natural environment, e.g. on a tree. A sphere is used as reference system; an apple fruit is considered as model system. CFD validation is performed for a sphere, indicating a very good performance of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes shear stress transport k-?? turbulence model for the drag coefficient, Nusselt number, separation angle and recirculation length over a large Reynolds number range (10-3??10 
                        4). These quantities compare well for sphere and apple. The impact of discretely distributed microscopic scalar sources on the product surface on the convective transfer is analysed by explicitly modelling them. Such sources are representative for moisture loss through lenticels and cracks in the product's cuticle and evaporation of water or pesticide droplets at the surface. As scalar transfer is assumed only to occur locally at these sources, the active surface area is reduced. In this study, it is found that even at rather low surface coverage ratios, relatively large convective flow rates are found, indicating a non-linear dependency on the active surface area. This dependency is a function of coverage ratio, the Reynolds number and the source size. The proposed computational methodology for investigating the effects of these microscopic scalar sources shows a good performance, by which it is a viable alternative for experiments, which are very challenging at such small scales. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The built environment may influence health in part through the promotion of physical activity and exposure to pollution. To date, no studies have explored interactions between neighborhood walkability and air pollution exposure. METHODS: We estimated concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), a marker for direct vehicle emissions), and ozone (O(3)) and a neighborhood walkability score, for 49,702 (89{\%} of total) postal codes in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. NO concentrations were estimated from a land-use regression model, O(3) was estimated from ambient monitoring data; walkability was calculated based on geographic attributes such as land-use mix, street connectivity, and residential density. RESULTS: All three attributes exhibit an urban-rural gradient, with high walkability and NO concentrations, and low O(3) concentrations, near the city center. Lower-income areas tend to have higher NO concentrations and walkability and lower O(3) concentrations. Higher-income areas tend to have lower pollution (NO and O(3)). "Sweet-spot" neighborhoods (low pollution, high walkability) are generally located near but not at the city center and are almost exclusively higher income. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Increased concentration of activities in urban settings yields both health costs and benefits. Our research identifies neighborhoods that do especially well (and especially poorly) for walkability and air pollution exposure. Work is needed to ensure that the poor do not bear an undue burden of urban air pollution and that neighborhoods designed for walking, bicycling, or mass transit do not adversely affect resident's exposure to air pollution. Analyses presented here could be replicated in other cities and tracked over time to better understand interactions among neighborhood walkability, air pollution exposure, and income level.},

abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is the total one-sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area. It is a key parameter in ecophysiology, especially for scaling up the gas exchange from leaf to canopy level. It characterizes the canopy-atmosphere interface, where most of the energy fluxes exchange. It is also one of the most difficult to quantify properly, owing to large spatial and temporal variability. Many methods have been developed to quantify LAI from the ground and some of them are also suitable for describing other structural parameters of the canopy. This paper reviews the direct and indirect methods, the required instruments, their advantages, disadvantages and accuracy of the results. Analysis of the literature shows that most cross-validations between direct and indirect methods have pointed to a significant underestimation of LAI with the latter techniques, especially in forest stands. The two main causes for the discrepancy, clumping and contribution of stem and branches, are discussed and some recent theoretical or technical solutions are presented as potential improvements to reduce bias or discrepancies. The accuracy, sampling strategy and spatial validity of the LAI measurements have to be assessed for quality assurance of both the measurement and the modelling purposes of all the LAI-dependent ecophysiological and biophysical processes of canopies.},

abstract = {A neighbourhood-scale multi-layer urban canopy model of shortwave and longwave radiation exchange that explicitly includes the radiative effects of tall vegetation (trees) is presented. Tree foliage is permitted both between and above buildings, and mutual shading, emission and reflection between buildings and trees are included. The basic geometry is a two-dimensional canyon with leaf area density profiles and probabilistic variation of building height. Furthermore, the model accounts for three-dimensional path lengths through the foliage. Ray tracing determines the receipt of direct shortwave irradiance by building and foliage elements. View factors for longwave and shortwave diffuse radiation exchange are computed once at the start of the simulation using a Monte Carlo ray tracing approach; for subsequent model timesteps, matrix inversion rapidly solves infinite reflections and interception of emitted longwave between all elements. The model is designed to simulate any combination of shortwave and longwave radiation frequency bands, and to be portable to any neighbourhood-scale urban canopy geometry based on the urban canyon. Additionally, the model is sufficiently flexible to represent forest and forest-clearing scenarios. Model sensitivity tests demonstrate the model is robust and computationally feasible, and highlight the importance of vertical resolution to the performance of urban canopy radiation models. Full model evaluation is limited by the paucity of within-canyon radiation measurements in urban neighbourhoods with trees. Where appropriate model components are tested against analytic relations and results from an independent urban radiation transfer model. Furthermore, system response tests demonstrate the ability of the model to realistically distribute shortwave radiation among urban elements as a function of built form, solar angle and tree foliage height, density and clumping. Separate modelling of photosynthetically-active and near-infrared shortwave bands is shown to be important in some cases. Increased canyon height-to-width ratio and/or tree cover diminishes the net longwave radiation loss of individual canyon elements (e.g., floor, walls), but, notably, has little effect on the net longwave loss of the whole urban canopy. When combined with parametrizations for the impacts of trees on airflow and hydrological processes in the urban surface layer, the new radiation model extends the applicability of urban canopy models and permits more robust assessment of trees as tools to manage urban climate, air quality, human comfort and building energy loads.},

@article{Pataki2011,
abstract = {Despite its importance for urban planning, landscape management, and water management, there are very few in situ estimates of urban-forest transpiration. Because urban forests contain an unusual and diverse mix of species from many regions worldwide, we hypothesized that species composition would be a more important driver of spatial variability in urban-forest transpiration than meteorological variables in the Los Angeles (California, USA) region. We used constant-heat sap-flow sensors to monitor urban tree water use for 15 species at six locations throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. For many of these species no previous data on sap flux, water use, or water relations were available in the literature. To scale sap-flux measurements to whole trees we conducted a literature survey of radial trends in sap flux across multiple species and found consistent relationships for angiosperms vs. gymnosperms. We applied this relationship to our measurements and estimated whole-tree and plot-level transpiration at our sites. The results supported very large species differences in transpiration, with estimates ranging from 3.2 +/- 2.3 kg x tree(-1) x d(-1) in unirrigated Pinus canariensis (Canary Island pine) to 176.9 +/- 75.2 kg x tree(-1) x d(-1) in Platanus hybrida (London planetree) in the month of August. Other species with high daily transpiration rates included Ficus microcarpa (laurel fig), Gleditsia triacanthos (honeylocust), and Platanus racemosa (California sycamore). Despite irrigation and relatively large tree size, Brachychiton populneas (kurrajong), B. discolor (lacebark), Sequoia sempervirens (redwood), and Eucalyptus grandis (grand Eucalyptus) showed relatively low rates of transpiration, with values {\textless} 45 kg x tree(-1) x d(-1). When scaled to the plot level, transpiration rates were as high as 2 mm/d for sites that contained both species with high transpiration rates and high densities of planted trees. Because plot-level transpiration is highly dependent on tree density, we modeled transpiration as a function of both species and density to evaluate a likely range of values in irrigated urban forests. The results show that urban forests in irrigated, semi-arid regions can constitute a significant use of water, but water use can be mitigated by appropriate selection of site, management method, and species.},

@article{Wouters2016,
abstract = {This paper presents the Semi-empirical URban canopY parametrization (SURY) v1.0, which bridges the gap between bulk urban land-surface schemes and explicit-canyon schemes. Based on detailed observational studies, modelling experiments and available parameter inventories, it offers a robust translation of urban canopy parameters – containing the three-dimensional information – into bulk parameters. As a result, it brings canopy-dependent urban physics to existing bulk urban land-surface schemes of atmospheric models. At the same time, SURY preserves a low computational cost of bulk schemes for efficient numerical weather prediction and climate modelling at the convection-permitting scales. It offers versatility and consistency for employing both urban canopy parameters from bottom-up inventories and bulk parameters from top-down estimates. SURY is tested for Belgium at 2.8 km resolution with the COSMO-CLM model (v5.0{\_}clm6) that is extended with the bulk urban land-surface scheme TERRA{\_}URB (v2.0). The model reproduces very well the urban heat islands observed from in situ urban-climate observations, satellite imagery and tower observations, which is in contrast to the original COSMO-CLM model without an urban land-surface scheme. As an application of SURY, the sensitivity of atmospheric modelling with the COSMO-CLM model is addressed for the urban canopy parameter ranges from the local climate zones of http://WUDAPT.org. City-scale effects are found in modelling the land-surface temperatures, air temperatures and associated urban heat islands. Recommendations are formulated for more precise urban atmospheric modelling at the convection-permitting scales. It is concluded that urban canopy parametrizations including SURY, combined with the deployment of the WUDAPT urban database platform and advancements in atmospheric modelling systems, are essential.},

abstract = {This paper adds to the relatively few European studies on the pedestrian friendliness of urban areas, and on transport walking. Using the Human Environment Interaction (HEI) model (K??ller, 1991), the study explores the associations between perceived neighbourhood spatialphysical and social environment qualities and walking to neighbourhood destinations, and examines whether these associations are mediated by the emotional relationship to the residential neighbourhood. One hundred and ten urban residents in the city of Malm??, Sweden, completed a web-based survey, including measurements of walking intentions and behaviours, and the short version of both the Perceived Residential Environment Quality Indicators (PREQIs) and the Neighbourhood Attachment Scale (NAS). Structural Equation Modeling revealed direct effects of individual factors and neighbourhood spatial-physical and social environmental qualities on transport walking. The effect of environmental qualities was partly mediated by participants' emotional relationship to the residential neighbourhood. Spatial-physical as well as social-relational features of the neighbourhood seem to play a role in walking intentions and behaviours, thereby emphasising the importance of considering both aspects in measures to support urban pedestrian friendliness.},

abstract = {A forest canopy model is developed and coupled into the Regional Boundary Layer Model (RBLM) to fully consider the vertical structure of tree morphology. Instead of a slab surface model formerly used to represent trees in RBLM, the new version allows refinement of the radiation budgets as well as sensible and latent heat fluxes and, hence, more precise simulation of the thermal impacts of tree plantings on urban meteorological behavior. By applying this new version of RBLM, sensitivity tests are conducted to explore the potential impacts of different greenery scenarios on the thermal environment in an eastern Chinese city, Suzhou, during hot summer days. Greenings, both tree planting and grass surfacing, are beneficial in cooling the ambient air temperature. In general, tree planting is more beneficial than grass surfacing with the same coverage. In terms of surface energy balance, with tree coverage increasing from 0{\%} to 20{\%}, and then to 40{\%}, the average surface net radiation fluxes at noon (1200 LST) are 591, 512, and 421 W m(-2), respectively. Correspondingly, the Bowen ratio is reduced from 8.78 to 1.20 and then to 0.43 as result of the redistribution of solar energy absorbed at the ground. The cooling effect of trees is more significant at noontime and can remarkably lower the daily maximum air temperature in urban areas. The cooling effect of urban greenery increases with its coverage. Using the study results, a tree coverage of around 40{\%} may be a feasible and optimized urban greenery scheme.},

abstract = {Transpiration of urban forests in southern California is highly uncertain and challenging to quantify because of variability of tree characteristics and stomatal responses among species and locations. However, as California undergoes the most severe drought on record, it is imperative to develop approaches to estimating transpiration of irrigated urban trees (E Tree). We examined the landscape coefficient method that is recommended by the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) and widely used to estimate irrigation needs of urban landscapes. The CIMIS method uses reference evapotranspiration (ET 0) calculated from the Penman-­‐ Monteith equation and a set of species-­‐specific factors to adjust ET 0 for particular landscapes. We found a mismatch between CIMIS predictions and actual patterns of urban tree transpiration that we attributed to underrepresentation of tree physiological mechanisms in ET 0 . As an alternative, we propose an empirical model of E Tree based on in situ measurements on 108 urban trees (14 species) in the Los Angeles region: {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°"{\#}{\#} = {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°"{\#} (0.23{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°{\textperiodcentered} + 0.002{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}°¼ ! + 0.55). Here D is the vapor pressure deficit of the air, I 0 is incoming solar radiation and E ref is species-­‐ specific parameter representing E Tree at D = 1kPa that may be estimated using mean sapwood area of a tree stand. This model may be used to estimate E Tree for practical applications and to improve representation of irrigated urban forests in hydrologic models.},

@article{Sailor2015,
abstract = {Given increasing utility of numerical models to examine urban impacts on meteorology and climate, there exists an urgent need for accurate representation of seasonally and diurnally varying anthropogenic heating data, an important component of the urban energy budget for cities across the world. Incorporation of anthropogenic heating data as inputs to existing climate modeling systems has direct societal implications ranging from improved prediction of energy demand to health assessment, but such data are lacking for most cities. To address this deficiency we have applied a standardized procedure to develop a national database of seasonally and diurnally varying anthropogenic heating profiles for 61 of the largest cities in the United Stated (U.S.). Recognizing the importance of spatial scale, the anthropogenic heating database developed includes the city scale and the accompanying greater metropolitan area. Our analysis reveals that a single profile function can adequately represent anthropogenic heating during summer but two profile functions are required in winter, one for warm climate cities and another for cold climate cities. On average, although anthropogenic heating is 40{\%} larger in winter than summer, the electricity sector contribution peaks during summer and is smallest in winter. Because such data are similarly required for international cities where urban climate assessments are also ongoing, we have made a simple adjustment accounting for different international energy consumption rates relative to the U.S. to generate seasonally and diurnally varying anthropogenic heating profiles for a range of global cities. The methodological approach presented here is flexible and straightforwardly applicable to cities not modeled because of presently unavailable data. Because of the anticipated increase in global urban populations for many decades to come, characterizing this fundamental aspect of the urban environment - anthropogenic heating - is an essential element toward continued progress in urban climate assessment.},

This paper starts by introducing the necessity of a holistic, integrated, and multidisciplinary approach to the concept of smart cities. Smart cities are evolving by the creation of tools that are application specific; therefore, European classification of smart city applications will be reviewed (as authors have used these criteria to classify the analyzed applications) and the relationship between the different European smart classification standards are analyzed. Moreover, in order to see how reality aligns with the theoretical concept of smart cities, the authors analyzed 61 applications from 33 smart cities distributed in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. From these, 16 specific applications from eight cities have been selected and described in detail so they provide an overview of existing tools in different application areas, as defined by European standards. After showing actual smart cities, the concepts and steps for building future smart cities are suggested in a conclusion.},

By our analyses, we found that both the white and the green roofs are less impactive than the black one; with the thermal resistance, the biological activity of plants and the surface albedo playing a crucial role.},

abstract = {The potential of urban green coverage to mitigate human heat stress is studied using the ENVI met model V4. The simulation domain is a residential district in Freiburg, a mid-size city in Southwest Germany. It is characterised by residential buildings and street canyons with asphalt surfaces, grasslands and broad-leaved trees. The ENVI-met model was validated against human-biometeorological measurements and demonstrated good performance when simulating the urban thermal environment in terms of air temperature (Ta) and human heat stress in terms of mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). Simulations were performed for the heat wave day of 4 August 2003, which is a typical scenario for future summer weather in Central Europe as projected by climate models. Four scenarios with different types of green coverage were simulated. The results enable quantification of the daytime and nocturnal contributions of trees and grasslands, respectively, to the mitigation of human heat stress on different spatial scales. Averaged over 10-16 CET, trees on grasslands lead to a mitigation effect up to 2.7K for Ta, 39.1K for Tmrt and 17.4K for PET. In comparison, the effect of grasslands can be up to 3.4K for Ta, 7.5K for Tmrt and 4.9K for PET. Based on the findings, design implications are also provided from the perspective of urban human-biometeorology.},

abstract = {Despite the many benefits of vegetation in urban settings, inner-city areas often are sparsely vegetated or devoid of plants. This suggests substantial opportunity for improving provision of ecosystem services in densely populated areas, through retrofitting of urban environments with plants. This paper introduces the concept of 'biological potential' - the pragmatic potential for urban areas to be retrofitted with suitable green infrastructure.This paper demonstrates a method for making a quantitative, spatially explicit estimate of the biological potential of walls in the CBD of Melbourne, Australia. The results of this study represent an estimate of how much wall space could be home to green fa??ade plants (i.e. creepers and climbers). The methodology is also spatially explicit - it estimates where the best locations in the city are for this kind of greening, recognising that not all walls have suitable physical characteristics or local microclimates. Employing a combination of GIS and microclimatic modelling techniques, this study estimates that over 16 ha of wall space has potential for greening in Melbourne's CBD, with 1.8 ha showing optimal characteristics.},

abstract = {Purpose. Walking can be incorporated into most people's daily routines if the process is made convenient by a well-designed built environment. Walkability rarely is assessed in the workplace, where adults spend much of their time. Methods. From existing tools, we developed an instrument to audit walkability at a single government agency's facilities, which were located in multiple states. We used a five-point scale to evaluate nine elements of walkability: pedestrian facilities, pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, crosswalks, route maintenance, walkway width, roadway buffer, universal accessi-bility, aesthetics, and shade. Weighted scores ranged from 20 to 39 (poor), to 40 to 69 (fair), to 70 to 100 (good). Results. Of 79 walking route segments surveyed on 10 agency campuses, 34{\%} were rated poor, 32{\%} fair, and 34{\%} good. Repeat assessment of 20 walking route segments by three independent observers yielded similar scores. Conclusion. Facility planners may find this walkability instrument useful in identifying and eliminating barriers to convenient walking opportunities in workplaces such as office parks and university campuses.

However, most research has focused on measuring objective features of the built environment, and fewer studies have looked at the more subjective features such as design quality that may influence how youth experience walking. Furthermore, many instruments that measure design quality are based on expert approaches; few incorporate user-based (youth) feedback. In this pilot study, the authors used focus group methods with a youth panel (2 groups with 16 total participants) to investigate user-based opinion of design quality variables of the built environment that impact the walking behaviour of youth. Findings indicate that youth preference for design features is linked to walking motivation and preferred walking context.

This discussion of the conceptual basis and some preliminary results of the 1992-94 health status and risk factor survey in Mongolia serves to highlight some of the relationships existing between the general health status and potential risk factors observed among pastoral nomads. In addition to graphic description of the data, a statistical analysis suggests significant associations between certain health status indicators and gender, location, lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking) socio-economic status, preventive health care and the physical environment. With regard to locational factors, there are strong regional differences in a wide-ranging number of health status indicators. The results of this study, obtained as they were at the threshold of Mongolia's economic and political transformation, will serve as a baseline against which to evaluate future changes in the health of Mongolians.},

abstract = {"Climate dice," describing the chance of unusually warm or cool seasons, have become more and more "loaded" in the past 30 y, coincident with rapid global warming. The distribution of seasonal mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the range of anomalies has increased. An important change is the emergence of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more than three standard deviations (3$\sigma$) warmer than the climatology of the 1951-1980 base period. This hot extreme, which covered much less than 1{\%} of Earth's surface during the base period, now typically covers about 10{\%} of the land area. It follows that we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small. We discuss practical implications of this substantial, growing, climate change.},

abstract = {This article shows how the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have made bicycling a safe, convenient and practical way to get around their cities. The analysis relies on national aggregate data as well as case studies of large and small cities in each country. The key to achieving high levels of cycling appears to be the provision of separate cycling facilities along heavily travelled roads and at intersections, combined with traffic calming of most residential neighbourhoods. Extensive cycling rights of way in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are complemented by ample bike parking, full integration with public transport, comprehensive traffic education and training of both cyclists and motorists, and a wide range of promotional events intended to generate enthusiasm and wide public support for cycling. In addition to their many pro-bike policies and programmes, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany make driving expensive as well as inconvenient in central cities through a host of taxes and restrictions on car ownership, use and parking. Moreover, strict land-use policies foster compact, mixed-use developments that generate shorter and thus more bikeable trips. It is the coordinated implementation of this multi-faceted, mutually reinforcing set of policies that best explains the success of these three countries in promoting cycling. For comparison, the article portrays the marginal status of cycling in the UK and the USA, where only about 1{\%} of trips are by bike. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Matzarakis2007,
abstract = {The most important meteorological parameter affecting the human energy balance during sunny weather conditions is the mean radiant temperature T(mrt). It considers the uniform temperature of a surrounding surface giving off blackbody radiation, which results in the same energy gain of a human body given the prevailing radiation fluxes. This energy gain usually varies considerably in open space conditions. In this paper, the model 'RayMan', used for the calculation of short- and long-wave radiation fluxes on the human body, is presented. The model, which takes complex urban structures into account, is suitable for several applications in urban areas such as urban planning and street design. The final output of the model is, however, the calculated T(mrt), which is required in the human energy balance model, and thus also for the assessment of the urban bioclimate, with the use of thermal indices such as predicted mean vote (PMV), physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and standard effective temperature (SET*). The model has been developed based on the German VDI-Guidelines 3789, Part II (environmental meteorology, interactions between atmosphere and surfaces; calculation of short- and long-wave radiation) and VDI-3787 (environmental meteorology, methods for the human-biometeorological evaluation of climate and air quality for urban and regional planning. Part I: climate). The validation of the results of the RayMan model agrees with similar results obtained from experimental studies.},

abstract = {The present paper is the second part of our study in which we compare the results obtained in Szeged (Hungary) with those achieved through earlier outdoor thermal comfort projects based on simultaneous questionnaire surveys and on-site meteorological measurements. The main characteristics of the selected studies-conducted in Hungary, Sweden, Portugal, Canada, Taiwan and across Europe in the frame of project RUROS-are reviewed, emphasizing the common features and also the discrepancies in the applied methodology. We discuss their potential effects on the evolution and interpretation of the results concerning the subjective assessment of the thermal environment. Another aspect of the comparison focuses on the regional climatic differences naturally ensuing from the various locations, which left their marks on the results related to both physiological acclimatization and mental adaptation. The compared results of different studies include correlation coefficients expressing interrelationships between the different aspects of subjective estimations (thermal sensation, perceptions, preferences) and also between subjective assessments and the corresponding meteorological parameters. We compare neutral temperatures (expressed in physiological equivalent temperature, PET) which arose for Taiwan and Hungary, as well as thermal sensation zones for local inhabitants. Subjectively assessed temperature values of Sweden and Hungarians are analyzed according to the measured air temperature. According to our experiences the methodology should be standardized for the level of field surveys and also for the level of data processing in order to make the data collected in different locations comparable.},

It stresses the importance of linking the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity to the Millennium Development Goals and to issues of immediate concern to policy-makers such as the economy, security and human health. It briefly discusses the process of decision-making and how the scientific and policy communities have successfully worked together on global environmental issues such as stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change, and the critical role of international assessments in providing the scientific basis for informed policy at the national and international level. The paper also discusses the drivers of global environmental change, the importance of constructing plausible futures, indicators of change, the biodiversity 2010 target and how environmental issues such as loss of biodiversity, stratospheric ozone depletion, land degradation, water pollution and climate change cannot be addressed in isolation because they are strongly interconnected and there are synergies and trade-offs among the policies, practices and technologies that are used to address these issues individually.},

abstract = {Urban sprawl has resulted in numerous land-lost farmers who must relocate from villages to residential quarters. The spatial landscapes of new homelands have profoundly changed, which is necessary for the succession of settlements. This study explored the spatial patterns of trees adjacent to buildings from traditional villages to relocated farmers' quarters in Shanghai, China. The stratified systematic method was adopted for 24 samples of 10 traditional villages, six relocated quarters in the late 1990s, and eight relocated quarters in the mid-2000s. Chessboard sampling was used to obtain 258 sample plots. A sketch map of every plot was premade for the investigation, which was conducted in 2009 and 2010. The four factors of tree height, defoliation, direction, and spacing were encoded for quantified analysis. The primary research results are as follows: the quarters had higher defoliation ratios than the villages (1.069 and 0.749, respectively), which means that there were more evergreens in the quarters and more deciduous plants in the villages. Most individual trees were to the north in the villages, but to the south in the quarters. The percentages of trees showed a nearly monotone decreasing trend for spacing in the quarters and near homogenization in the villages. For the villages, a valuable model is given of layered greening with upper deciduous and lower evergreen plants. More trees should be planted to the north as a barrier against cold wind in winter, and there should be open spaces in front of windows for sunshine, ventilation, and views of the outward landscape. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

@article{Defraeye2013,
abstract = {Knowledge on convective water vapour exchange at leaf-air interfaces is required to assess transpiration of leaves via stomata and evaporation of droplets, which can both be considered as microscopic moisture sources, heterogeneously distributed across the leaf. An innovative modelling approach was proposed to investigate such convective mass transport from leaf surfaces, using computational fluid dynamics (shear-stress transport k-?? turbulence model with low-Reynolds number modelling). The main novelty lies in the fact that a large range of spatial scales (10-5-10-1 m) was included and that the individual microscopic sources were modelled discretely. The convective exchange from the leaf model was strongly dependent on three parameters: surface coverage, air speed and source size. The relation between the convective flow rate and both the coverage ratio (CR) and the microscopic Sherwood number, i.e., the ratio of the source size to the viscous sublayer thickness, was quantified. It was shown that well-established convective transfer coefficients, obtained from plates or leaf models for a CR of 100{\%}, can result in a significant overprediction of the convective exchange, compared to more realistic, lower CR. Furthermore, small variations in stomatal density (CR), e.g., due to biological variability, were shown to have a large impact on the convective exchange and droplets were found to evaporate more rapidly at low CR. The decrease in mass transfer rate due to stomatal closure was quantified as well. The proposed numerical modelling approach can be applied to increase our understanding of leaf transpiration and droplet evaporation, but also of the leaf boundary-layer microclimate and the transport processes therein. A critical discussion of the modelling assumptions allowed to identify focus points for future model refinement as well as future research. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This study investigated commuters who recently began using PBS to access the metro, referred to herein as the metro-PBS, and commuters who drive to work in suburban Nanjing, China, which is an area where PBS is in early developmental stages. First, a survey was conducted to obtain the personal characteristics of the metro-PBS users and their before-and-after commuting experiences. Then, a comparative analysis was performed, which revealed that saving time, energy, and money are the critical motivating factors of their mode shift behavior. The users' personal characteristics vary with their previous modes, but the users are generally characterized as well educated with regard to environmental protection.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the available scientific evidence based on peer-reviewed publications concerning the effectiveness of red light cameras (RLCs) within the U.S. traffic system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Relevant literature published prior to December 2012 was retrieved from the PubMed, Medline, and Engineering Index databases using free-text term queries. Jurisdictions with either a fixed number of RLCs studied or area wide programs within the United States were included. RLC studies with additional interventions were excluded. Nine RLC studies were extracted and grouped into 3 categories based on outcome measures: violations, crashes, and injuries/fatalities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All 9 studies reviewed showed significant reductions in the frequency/rate of violations, crashes, and injuries at intersections after RLC implementation. RLC interventions appear to decrease violations, crashes, and injuries at intersections.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Despite limited peer-reviewed publications available in the literature, it appears that RLCs decrease violations, crashes, and injuries at intersections. Some studies, however, contained methodological shortcomings. Therefore, the apparent effectiveness should be confirmed with stronger methodological approaches. Although spillover effects appeared to be evident, many of the jurisdictions examined were small in area. Thus, it is unknown whether spillover resulting from RLCs would have similar effects in large metropolitan areas. To determine the full public health impact of RLC programs, crashes, injuries, and fatalities should be considered as primary outcomes of interest. To accomplish this requires a clear definition of which types of crashes will be included for RLC studies. Lastly, it is unknown whether RLCs would be effective in reducing crashes resulting from distracted or alcohol-impaired drivers. Future studies should examine the effects of RLCs by exclusively analyzing these crash types.},

About 200 planners, engineers, and other urban street design professionals attended to hear presentations about numerous urban street design topics, ranging from designing for those with disabilities to flexible and neo-traditional street design. The Urban Street Symposium was conceived with the goal of achieving the following objectives. 1. Provide a forum for comparison and debate of alternative urban street design practices. 2. Highlight problems caused by certain design practices, and better alternatives. 3. Promote applications of research. 4. Reconsider long-held urban street design practices in light of the “new urbanism” movement. 5. Document better urban street design practices. 6. Show “how to do it.” 7. Share innovations with others. 8. Transfer urban street research findings to state agencies and to local governments.},

abstract = {Trees in urban ecosystems are valued for shade and cooling effects, reduction of CO2 emissions and pollution, and aesthetics, among other benefits. However, in arid and semi-arid regions, urban trees must be maintained through supplemental irrigation. In these regions it is desirable to identify tree species that are especially efficient in the balance between water loss and carbon uptake. We used a common garden approach to compare water use efficiency (WUE) at leaf and tree scales for commonly planted, non-native tree species in the Los Angeles Basin, in order to evaluate WUE as a metric of the tradeoff between water use and growth in urban trees. Leaf level gas exchange, sap flux density, leaf {\{}lower case delta{\}}13C and stem growth measurements were conducted on eight species within the Los Angeles County Arboretum: Brachychiton discolor, Brachychiton populneus, Eucalyptus grandis, Ficus microcarpa, Jacaranda chelonia, Gleditsia triacanthos, Lagerstroemia indica, and Koelreuteria paniculata.

abstract = {Neighborhood walkability can influence physical activity. We evaluated the validity of Walk Score{\textregistered} for assessing neighborhood walkability based on GIS (objective) indicators of neighborhood walkability with addresses from four US metropolitan areas with several street network buffer distances (i.e., 400-, 800-, and 1,600-meters). Address data come from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5–11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programs located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the US (n = 733). GIS data were used to measure multiple objective indicators of neighborhood walkability. Walk Scores were also obtained for the participant's residential addresses. Spearman correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. There were many significant moderate correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators such as density of retail destinations and intersection density (p {\textless} 0.05). The magnitude varied by the GIS indicator of neighborhood walkability. Correlations generally became stronger with a larger spatial scale, and there were some geographic differences. Walk Score{\textregistered} is free and publicly available for public health researchers and practitioners. Results from our study suggest that Walk Score{\textregistered} is a valid measure of estimating certain aspects of neighborhood walkability, particularly at the 1600-meter buffer. As such, our study confirms and extends the generalizability of previous findings demonstrating that Walk Score is a valid measure of estimating neighborhood walkability in multiple geographic locations and at multiple spatial scales.},

abstract = {This study contributes to understanding of social preferences, norms, and behaviors in residential landscapes that affect planning, design, and management of trees, which store carbon and contribute to mitigating climate change. We investigated southeast Michigan homeowner preferences for different styles of front yards and backyards that were more or less wooded, learning what landscape characteristics they preferred and how their preferences related to their own yard management behavior. We surveyed homeowners, who selected their most preferred front yard and backyard from a series of images and indicated what characteristics were important to their preferences. We developed a homeowner typology based on their stated preferences for more and less wooded front yards and backyards, distinguished each type by landscape characteristics that were most important to homeowners, and tested whether homeowners of each preference type managed their actual yards consistent with type. Our results show that homeowners are heterogeneous in their preferences, identifying different characteristics as important according to type, but that only mowing of their actual yard is consistent with type. We also found that both important characteristics and actual uses of homeowners' yards varied between front yards and backyards. Both homeowner types and front yard/backyard differences suggest opportunities for planning and maintaining larger urban woodlands on residential lots.},

abstract = {New Zealand is a country of marked local and regional environmental variability. The complexity of the terrain and significant relief of this island nation surrounded by extensive areas of ocean produce rapid changes of climate over relatively short distances. This article provides a selective review of recent research into the mesoscale and local climates of this interestingly varied environment. Research completed on energy budgets of the varying surface types provides the starting point for an assessment of thermal effects on the atmospheric boundary layer and airflow. The dynamic effects of surface topography are also seen to have a major impact on regional and local airflow patterns, as well as on mesoscale variations of convection and precipitation. It is clear that the interaction of mid-latitude synoptic weather systems with the mountains of New Zealand produces distinct patterns of wind and rainfall that have a major impact on the physical and human environment of the country. The f{\"{o}}hn nor'wester and southerly changes are significant local meteorological phenomena, while mesoscale climate processes are increasingly recognized as important for agricultural activities, the management of hydrological systems and in dealing with environmental problems such as air pollution},

We argue that the carbon balance ap- proach is readily applicable for projecting forest yield and productivity, and review several carbon balance models for es- timating stand productivity and individual tree growth and competition.Wepropose that to develop operational models, it is necessary to accept that all models may have both empirical and causal components at the system level. We present exam- ples of hybrid carbon balance models and consider issues that currently require incorporation of empirical information at the system level. We review model calibration and validation methods that take account of the hybrid character of models. The operational implementation of process-based models to practical forest management is discussed. Methods of deci- sion-making in forest management are gradually moving to- ward a more general, analytical approach, and it seems likely that models that include some process-oriented components will soon be used in forestry enterprises. This development is likely to run parallel with the further development of ecophysiologically based models.},

We examined: (1) the impact of parents' fear of strangers on children's independent mobility; and (2) whether informal social control (i.e., parents' confidence that other residents would look out for local children) mitigated any association. Gender stratified logistic regression models tested these associations for 10-12 year-olds and their parents (n=1231) in Perth, Australia. For girls, parental fear of strangers was associated with lower odds of independent mobility (OR=0.71, p=0.002), and informal social control and other social and built environment variables had little attenuating influence. This pattern was consistent for boys; however odds ratios were lower and statistical significance weaker. Initiatives that target parental fears combined with interventions that normalise children's walking may help increase independent mobility.},

abstract = {Silicon (Si) is an important structural element that can accumulate at high concentrations in grasses and sedges, and therefore Si structures might affect the optical properties of the leaves. To better understand the role of Si in light/leaf interactions in species rich in Si, we examined the total Si and silica phytoliths, the biochemical and morphological leaf properties, and the reflectance and transmittance spectra in grasses (Phragmites australis, Phalaris arundinacea, Molinia caerulea, Deschampsia cespitosa) and sedge (Carex elata). We show that these grasses contain {\textgreater}1{\%} phytoliths per dry mass, while the sedge contains only 0.4{\%}. The data reveal the variable leaf structures of these species and significant differences in the amount of Si and phytoliths between developing and mature leaves within each species and between grasses and sedge, with little difference seen among the grass species. Redundancy analysis shows the significant roles of the different near-surface silicified leaf structures (e.g., prickle hairs, cuticle, epidermis), phytoliths and Si contents, which explain the majority of the reflectance and transmittance spectra variability. The amount of explained variance differs between mature and developing leaves. The transmittance spectra are also significantly affected by chlorophyll a content and calcium levels in the leaf tissue.?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The way a street tree is able to modify the local microclimate on pedestrian walkways may vary according to tree species according to key canopy and leaf characteristics, such as leaf angle, leaf size, canopy architecture or simply canopy density. Three similar north-south orientated streets, with three different tree species possessing different canopy and leaf characteristics were studied in summer 2014. Microclimatic parameters were measured on pedestrian walkways below and away from tree canopies between 06:00 and 20:00 on three cloudless days. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was estimated to indicate pedestrian thermal comfort. Microclimate conditions were measured below and away from trees at solar noon for a wide range of trees with different Plant Area Index (PAI) as determined using full-frame photography. In streets with Ulmus procera and Platanus x acerifolia trees, the microclimatic benefits were significantly greater than the street with Eucalyptus scoparia trees, however no significant differences in the estimated PET. Microclimate benefit increased with increasing PAI for all three tree species, however no significant difference in under-canopy microclimate amongst tree species when the PAI was similar. It appears that differences in PAI are paramount in determining the microclimatic and PET benefits. Obviously, certain tree species have a limit of the PAI they can achieve, and that should be considered when selecting or comparing tree species for shading and cooling benefits. This study assists urban planners and landscape professionals in selecting street tree species for cooling benefits based on the expected or managed tree canopy area.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This study evaluates the ability of the JULES Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) at regional and global scales for 2001{\&}ndash;2010. Model simulations, performed at various spatial resolutions and driven with a variety of meteorological datasets (WFDEI-GPCC, WFDEI-CRU and PRINCETON), were compared to the MODIS GPP product, spatially gridded estimates of upscaled GPP from the FLUXNET network (FLUXNET-MTE) and the CARDAMOM terrestrial carbon cycle analysis. Firstly, JULES was found to simulate interannual variability (IAV) at global scales. When JULES was driven with the WFDEI-GPCC dataset (at 0.5{\textordmasculine} {\&}times; 0.5{\textordmasculine} spatial resolution), it was found that the annual average global GPP simulated by JULES for 2001{\&}ndash;2010 was higher than the observation-based estimates (MODIS and FLUXNET-MTE), by 25{\&}thinsp;{\%} and 8{\&}thinsp;{\%}, respectively, and CARDAMOM estimates by 23{\&}thinsp;{\%}. Secondly, GPP fluxes simulated by JULES for various biomes (forests, grasslands and shrubs) at global and regional scales were compared. It was found that differences between JULES, FLUXNET-MTE, MODIS and CARDAMOM at global scales were mostly due to differences in the tropics with CARDAMOM performing better than JULES in this region. Thirdly, it was shown that spatial resolution (0.5{\textordmasculine} {\&}times; 0.5{\textordmasculine}, 1{\textordmasculine} {\&}times; 1{\textordmasculine} and 2{\textordmasculine} {\&}times; 2{\textordmasculine}) had no impact on simulated GPP on these large scales. Finally, the sensitivity of JULES to meteorological driving data, a major source of model uncertainty, was examined.

@article{Kato1997,
abstract = {A comparison of five independent measurements of the clear-sky downward shortwave irradiance at the surface shows that they scatter within a 5{\%} range depending on their calibration constants. When the measurements are corrected using data from two cavity radiometers, three of the five independent measurements agree within 3 W m(-2) over three clear-sky days, which is well within the estimated error limit of +/-1.5{\%}. A comparison of these three sets of irradiance measurements with the computed irradiance by a delta 2-stream model reveals that the model overestimates the irradiance by 5{\%}. Detailed investigation of the approximations and uncertainties associated with the computations (including the measurement error in the water vapor and ozone amounts, neglecting the state of polarization and trace gas absorption, the 2-stream approximation, the neglect of the spectral dependence of the surface albedo, and the uncertainties associated with aerosols) demonstrates that the discrepancy is not due to these approximations. Further analysis of the modeled and measured irradiance shows that the discrepancy is almost entirely due to the difference between modeled and measured diffuse field irradiances. An analysis of narrow-band diffuse to total irradiance ratios shows that this discrepancy is the largest near 400 nm and decreases with wavelength. These results rely on the absolute calibrations of two cavity radiometers, two shaded pyranometers, and one unshaded pyranometer, as well as ratios of irradiances measured by a multifilter rotating shadow-band radiometer. Therefore, in order for instrumental error to account for the diffuse field discrepancy, three independent measurements of the diffuse held irradiance must be biased low by at least 40{\%}. For an aerosol to account for this discrepancy, it must be highly absorbing with a single-scattering albedo as low as 0.3. The unlikelihood of instrumental errors of 40{\%} and aerosol single-scattering albedos of 0.3 suggests a third possibility: the neglect of some gaseous absorption process at visible wavelengths.

abstract = {A relatively recent body of literature has looked critically at the role of car parking in urban areas, showing that a significant determinant of the extent of parking space is the planning system. Of particular importance are statutory minimum off-street parking requirements for new developments. If parking and parking policies are significant to urban outcomes, one question that follows is − how active a role (if any) has strategic urban planning had in car parking? In this paper we ask if, and in what ways, car parking has been a stated strategic planning interest over the course of nearly a century of planning for one city − Melbourne, Australia. Our approach has three parts: a content analysis of strategic planning documents over time; a corresponding analysis of statutory policies on the ground; and reflection on what this means for the relationships between strategy and policy. We find that extensive car parking, treated as a public good, was once specifically planned as a critical component of facilitating a car-based city. We show that car parking has receded as a strategic policy issue over time, but that statutory minimum parking requirements introduced in the 1950s continue to be entrenched. Even with more recent strategic plans seeking to curtail car use and increase urban densities, minimum parking policies originally introduced to achieve the opposite effects have remained largely intact. We argue that parking has a significant role in urban form but is, in our case study city, illustrative of gaps between strategic and statutory planning, and between planning practice and research. Whereas post-war planning instigated policy approaches to car parking as a means of planning for car use, strategic planning in Melbourne now plans around parking − the elephant in the scheme. The findings have implications for other intensifying cities with a history of minimum parking policies; as well as for cities now undergoing rapid motorisation.},

Recordings were made of local temperatures, both of the air and the infra-red long-wave sky. The UHI temperature structure has been studied under both clear and cloudy skies and with a number of wind speeds. It is most prominent under clear skies and low wind conditions with the phenomenon being lost at wind speeds above approximately 3 ms-1. The air (screen) temperature variation is greatly exceeded in magnitude by the sky temperature variation although, at fixed locations, the magnitude of the temporal variation of sky temperature is similar to, or less than, that of the screen temperature. This suggests the possibility that UHI spatial structure is associated with local greenhouse gases and that infra-red measurements from ground level are a useful tool for UHI studies.},

abstract = {Since Western lifestyles can foster obesity and other problems, attention is turning to active travel (AT) as a means of increasing physical activity for both adults and children. Children's routines regularly focus on trips to and from school which can admit walking and other AT. Yet promoting such an approach encounters a problem around the relative influence on AT of urban form and family decision making. To address it, this study applies the recently-constructed Model of Children's Active Travel (M-CAT). Via its formulations, two field sites in Queensland, Australia, were selected based on objective physical characteristics, determined as supportive and not supportive of children's AT. Parents of 206 children aged 9 to 12 years were surveyed. While 43{\%} reported that their children used AT, a significant difference was observed among children dwelling in areas identified as having high as opposed to low support. Behind this clear result, objective attributes of the physical environment, parents' perceptions and evaluations of urban form and child and family characteristics link in intricate ways to determine children's level of engagement. The inquiry argues for an interdisciplinary approach involving urban designers, planners and health care professionals to address a complex physical and social interaction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {'Research Through Designing' (RTD) is a research method that is based on the active employment of designing in the research process. Often, RTD is necessary to generate knowledge that is relevant for design such as design guidelines or prototypes. A broad range of RTD methods can be used to produce such results: post-positivist, constructivist, participatory and pragmatist approaches. The aim of this paper is to elucidate the post-positivist RTD methods through the discussion of examples. The examples represent microclimate responsive design research and were derived from an extensive literature review. The typical issues to be dealt with in such studies are discussed: complexity, scale, testing methods and their mutual relations. A distinction is made between RTD methods and other design research for microclimatic improvement. Three studies occurred to be RTD in the literal sense and they provide a methodological model for further research to generate evidence that supports urban microclimate responsive design.},

abstract = {We modeled the effects of climate change and two forest management scenarios on wood production and forest carbon balance in French forests using process-based models of forest growth. We combined data from the national forest inventory and soil network survey, which were aggregated over a 50 x 50-km grid, i.e., the spatial resolution of the climate scenario data. We predicted and analyzed the climate impact on potential forest production over the period 1960-2100. All models predicted a slight increase in potential forest yield until 2030-2050, followed by a plateau or a decline around 2070-2100, with overall, a greater increase in yield in northern France than in the south. Gross and net primary productivities were more negatively affected by soil water and atmospheric water vapor saturation deficits in western France because of a more pronounced shift in seasonal rainfall from summer to winter. The rotation-averaged values of carbon flux and production for different forest management options were estimated during four years (1980, 2015, 2045 and 2080). Predictions were made using a two-dimensional matrix covering the range of local soil and climate conditions. The changes in ecosystem fluxes and forest production were explained by the counterbalancing effect of rising CO2 concentration and increasing water deficit. The effect of climate change decreased with rotation length from short rotations with high production rates and low standing biomasses to long rotations with low productivities and greater standing biomasses. Climate effects on productivity, both negative and positive, were greatest on high fertility sites. Forest productivity in northern France was enhanced by climate change, increasingly from west to east, whereas in the southwestern Atlantic region, productivity was reduced by climate change to an increasing degree from west to east.},

abstract = {To balance the needs of people and biodiversity in cities, local governments are increasingly incorporating green spaces and urban greening initiatives into urban planning frameworks. Despite this, there is little information on which vegetation features or management actions are most useful in supporting biodiversity within these green spaces. We assess the effect of three vegetation management approaches that are commonly suggested to improve outcomes for urban biodiversity, including: (1) increasing the proportion of native vegetation; (2) increasing the density of trees, and (3) increasing the volume or complexity of understorey vegetation. We use a network of 39 urban green spaces (including golf courses, public parks and residential neighbourhoods) to assess how these vegetation management approaches impact urban bird and bat communities. The richness of both birds and bats increased with an increase in the proportion of native plants, bird species richness increased with increasing volume of understorey vegetation, and increasing large tree density led to increased bat activity. Our study suggests that increasing native vegetation composition and understorey vegetation volume, and the retention of large trees are practical vegetation management approaches that improve outcomes for urban birds and bats. Our data also suggests that as urbanisation and infill development proceeds, retention of large green spaces (such as golf courses) will be critical for urban biodiversity conservation, as these areas supported a component of the bird and bat fauna which was not recorded in other green space types.},

In this paper, the Poisson generalized additive regression model was used to estimate the impact of apparent temperature (heat index) and daily mortality and morbidity during the July 2006 heat wave. Daily mortality, morbidity and heat index were correlated with lags of apparent temperature up to 7 days using Pearson correlation. For a 1°C increase in mean apparent temperature we observed a 2.7 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 1.7-3.6 {\%}) increase in mortality (all cause), a 1.7 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 0.6-2.9 {\%}) increase in respiratory morbidity, a 2.2 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 0.4-4.1 {\%}) increase in respiratory morbidity in women, a 5.4 {\%} (95{\%}CI: 1.1-6.6 {\%}) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary morbidity, and a 7.5 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 1.3-14.1 {\%}) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary morbidity in women, for the entire population. For people ≥ 75 years, our results showed a 3.3 {\%} increase (95 {\%} CI: 1.7-5.0 {\%}) in respiratory morbidity, a 2.7 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 0.4-5.1 {\%}) increase in respiratory morbidity in men, a 3.9 {\%} (95 {\%}CI: 1.6-6.3 {\%}) increase in respiratory morbidity in women, a 7.0 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 1.1-13.2 {\%}) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a 9.0 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 0.3-18.5 {\%}) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in women. The use of heat index in a Mediterranean tempered climate enabled the identification of the effects of the July 2006 heat wave in mortality due to all causes and in respiratory morbidity of the general population, as well as in respiratory morbidity of individuals with more than 74 years of age.},

abstract = {A key strategy in soybean drought research is increased stomatal sensitivity to high VPD, which contributes to the 'slow wilting' trait observed in the field. These experiments examined whether temperature of the growth environment affected the ability of plants to respond to VPD, and thus control transpiration rate (TR). Two soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and four wild soybean [Glycine soja (Sieb. and Zucc.)] genotypes were studied. The TR was measured over a range of VPD when plants were growing at 25°C or 30°C, and again after an abrupt increase of 5°C. In G. max, a restriction of TR became evident as VPD increased above 2.0 kPa when temperature was near its growth optimum of 30°C. 'Slow wilting' genotype PI 416937 exhibited greater TR control at high VPD compared to Hutcheson, and only PI 416937 restrained TR after the shift to 35°C. Three of the four G. soja genotypes exhibited control over TR with increasing VPD when grown at 25°C, which is near their estimated growth optimum. The TR control became engaged at lower VPD than in G. max and was retained to differing degrees after a shift to 30°C. The TR control systems in G. max and G. soja clearly were temperature-sensitive and kinetically definable, and more restrictive in the 'slow wilting' soybean genotype. For the favorable TR control traits observed in G. soja to be useful in soybean breeding for warmer climates, the regulatory linkage with lower temperatures must be uncoupled.},

abstract = {Schemes to modify large-scale environment systems or control climate have been proposed for over 50 years to (i) increase temperatures in high latitudes, (ii) increase precipitation, (iii) decrease sea ice, (iv) create irrigation opportunities, or (v) offset potential global warming by injecting iron in the oceans or sea-salt aerosol in the marine boundary layer or spreading dust in the stratosphere to reflect away an amount of solar energy equivalent to the amount of heat trapped by increased greenhouse gases from human activities. These and other proposed geoengineering schemes are briefly reviewed. Recent schemes to intentionally modify climate have been proposed as either cheaper methods to counteract inadvertent climatic modifications than conventional mitigation techniques such as carbon taxes or pollutant emissions regulations or as a counter to rising emissions as governments delay policy action. Whereas proponents argue cost-effectiveness or the need to be prepared if mitigation and adaptation policies are not strong enough or enacted quickly enough to avoid the worst widespread impacts, critics point to the uncertainty that (i) any geoengineering scheme would work as planned or (ii) that the many centuries of international political stability and cooperation needed for the continuous maintenance of such schemes to offset century-long inadvertent effects is socially feasible. Moreover, the potential exists for transboundary conflicts should negative climatic events occur during geoengineering activities.},

@article{Balstad2012,
abstract = {"Climate dice," describing the chance of unusually warm or cool seasons, have become more and more "loaded" in the past 30 y, coincident with rapid global warming. The distribution of seasonal mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the range of anomalies has increased. An important change is the emergence of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more than three standard deviations (3$\sigma$) warmer than the climatology of the 1951-1980 base period. This hot extreme, which covered much less than 1{\%} of Earth's surface during the base period, now typically covers about 10{\%} of the land area. It follows that we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small. We discuss practical implications of this substantial, growing, climate change.},

abstract = {Motorized automobility and suburban living are not only highly valued but are also associated with a range of serious social problems, including deaths and injuries of motor-vehicle users and nonusers, roadway congestion, air pollution, dependence on insecure oil supplies, community fragmentation, and climate change. However, these problems, which make the present transportation and land-use system unsustainable, are not necessary consequences of automobility and suburban living per se, but rather are attributable mainly to the high kinetic energy of fast, heavy-motor vehicles (FHVs). Therefore, the challenge in creating a sustainable transportation and land-use system is to dramatically lower the kinetic energy of personal travel while retaining the advantages of personal motorized automobility and low-density development. Our approach is to redefine the technical artifact that is the conventional automobile and create two autonomous and universally accessible travel networks at a citywide scale: one for FHVs, the other for low-speed, low-mass modes including walking, cycling, and a new class of motor vehicles. In this paper, we motivate the need for this new urban-settlement and transportation-infrastructure scheme (USATIS), describe its design principles and features, review aspects of it in the literature and in the real world, present analyses covering a wide range of sustainability criteriasafety, mobility, congestion, environmental and energy-use impacts, urban aesthetics and community fragmentation, and economicsand discuss challenges for implementation and future research. We conclude that our USATIS does have the potential to support sustainable transportation without making people drive less or give up suburban living, but that before practical implementation plans can be considered, more research needs to be done on how people will adapt to the opportunities and constraints in the proposal.},

According to this preliminary and exploratory assessment, humanity's load corresponded to 70{\%} of the capacity of the global biosphere in 1961, and grew to 120{\%} in 1999.},

abstract = {This article focuses on micro-level walkability, which is measured at the route level and thus named “path walkability,” and tests whether path walkability influences transit users' mode choices to the station. To test its impact on access mode choices, a case study is conducted in downtown Mountain View, California. A station user survey is administered to collect access mode choice, socioeconomic status, and trip origins and walking routes of 249 transit users with previous experience of walking to the station. Using a path walkability measurement instrument developed for this research, 38 path walkability indicators are extracted from each of the 249 walking routes. The 38 walkability indicators are grouped by using factor analysis yielding four path walkability factors: “sidewalk amenities,” “traffic impacts,” “street scale and enclosure,” and “landscaping elements.” The four factors are utilized as new walkability variables for modeling access mode choices. With 150 walkers and 99 habitual auto users/occasional walkers, two access mode choice models are estimated. The basic model is first estimated without walkability variables and then the four path walkability variables are introduced for the expanded model. All four path walkability variables enter the expanded model and significantly improve the predictability of the mode choice model. The model result suggests that micro-level walkability influences access mode choices in a statistically significant way and having more walking-conducive walkability available for access trips increases the chance of choosing walking over driving. This research shows that improving micro-level walkability could be a cost-beneficial incentive for more walking to the station.},

Raki plants grown for 6 wk at either 350 or 700 µl l –1 CO 2 . • Plant biomass was doubled as a result of growth at high CO 2 and the shoot:root ratio was decreased. Stomatal density was increased in the leaves of the high CO 2 -grown plants, which had greater numbers of smaller stomata and more epidermal cells on the abaxial surface. • An asymmetric surface-specific regulation of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance was observed with respect to light orientation. This was not caused by dorso-ventral variations in leaf structure, the distribution of phospho enol pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) proteins or light absorptance, transmittance or reflectance. • Adaxial/abaxial specification in the regulation of photosynthesis results from differential sensitivity of stomatal opening to light orientation and fixed gradients of enzyme activation across the leaf.

abstract = {The adage "It's not what you know, it's who you know" is true. The right social network can have a huge impact on your success. But many people have misguided ideas about what makes a network strong: They believe the key is having a large circle filled with high-powered contacts. That's not the right approach, say Cross, of UVA's McIntire School of Commerce, and Thomas, of the Accenture Institute for High Performance. The authors, who have spent years researching how organizations can capitalize on employees' social networks, have seen that the happiest, highest-performing executives have a different kind of network: select but diverse, made up of high-quality relationships with people who come from varying spheres and from up and down the corporate ladder. Effective networks typically range in size from 12 to 18 people. They help managers learn, make decisions with less bias, and grow personally. Cross and Thomas have found that they include six critical kinds of connections: people who provide information, ideas, or expertise; formally and informally powerful people, who offer mentoring and political support; people who give developmental feedback; people who lend personal support; people who increase your sense of purpose or worth; and people who promote work/life balance. Moreover, the best kind of connections are "energizers"--positive, trustworthy individuals who enjoy other people and always see opportunities, even in challenging situations. If your network doesn't look like this, you can follow a four-step process to improve it. You'll need to identify who your connections are and what they offer you, back away from redundant and energy-draining connections, fill holes in your network with the right kind of people, and work to make the most of your contacts. Do this, and in due course, you'll have a network that steers the best opportunities, ideas, and talent your way.},

abstract = {A statistical interpolation method is proposed which allows calculation of the leaf area index LAI(t), the downward cumulative leaf area index L(z, t) and the canopy leaf area density u(z, t) as the functions of height and time for any day of the growth period. The method is based on three functions: probability density of stem height, interrelationship between stem height and stem foliage area, and the shape function of stem foliage vertical distribution. The method was elaborated in detail using phytometrical measurements carried out on willow coppice (Salix viminalis L.) during the growth period of 1998 in T{\~{o}}ravere, Estonia. The estimated values of u(z, t) and those calculated by the method differ by about 10–15{\%}. The interpolation model can be used when phytometrical data are available for certain days throughout the growing season. It could be applied to pure stands: young forests, orchard plantations, and maize, sorghum and cotton crops, etc.},

@article{Stevenson2014a,
abstract = {Road traffic injuries are already the leading cause of injury mortality and morbidity globally and by 2030 are predicted to be the fifth leading cause of mortality in the world. Australia has seen a dramatic reduction in road deaths and serious injuries since the 1970s and holds an international reputation for road traffic injury prevention due, in part, to its success in pioneering the multidisciplinary and intersectoral approach needed to address this significant issue and by applying an evidence-led approach to policy development. The paper will discuss Australia's early success in road traffic injury prevention (road safety), particularly the achievements following the implementation of targeted programs that focussed on road user behaviours for which health promotion played a role. The most successful of these programs was the introduction of comprehensive seat belt laws, random breath testing and more recently, strategic speed enforcement programs. Amid an array of significant challenges faced by the transport system in the future, the rapid development in information and communication technologies applied to transport is likely to provide the next generation of road safety benefits. The potential for a semi-autonomous transport system is likely to provide the next significant decline in road fatalities and serious injuries over the next 2 decades and the role of health promotion in relation to raising community engagement and building coalitions to increase uptake of new technologies will be discussed.},

@article{Ashbolt2012,
abstract = {Increases in the impervious area due to urbanisation have been shown to have negative impacts on the physical and ecological condition of streams, primarily through increased volume and frequency of runoff. The harvesting and detention of runoff has a potential to decrease this impact. This paper describes the effects of urbanisation on catchment flow and of stormwater harvesting on reducing those adverse impacts on a stream in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. A largely undeveloped catchment located southeast of Brisbane city was calibrated and validated using the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM). This model was used to investigate the effect of a range of future increases in urbanisation (represented by impervious area) on stream hydrology as well as the potential of stormwater harvesting to return the catchments to predevelopment flow conditions. Stormwater harvesting was modelled according to flow frequency measures specified in current SEQ development guidelines. These guidelines stipulate the capture of the first 10 mm of runoff from impervious areas of 0-40{\%} and the first 15 mm from impervious areas of 40{\%} or greater for urban developments. We found that increases in the impervious area resulted in increases in the mean, frequency and duration of high flows, and an increase in the mean rate of rise and fall for storm events in the catchment. However, the predevelopment (non-urbanised) flow distribution was very flashy in comparison with all urbanised scenarios; i.e. it had the quickest response to rainfall indicated by a high rate of rise to and fall from peak flow volume, followed by a return to zero flow conditions. Capturing the runoff according to the development guidelines resulted in a reduction in flow towards the flow distribution of a lower impervious area, however this was insufficient to meet predevelopment conditions. This suggests a stronger influence of impervious areas in this catchment on the volume of runoff than flow frequency measures are able to ameliorate.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}r.avaflow represents an innovative open source computational tool for routing rapid mass flows, avalanches or process chains from a defined release area down an arbitrary topography to a deposition area. In contrast to most existing computational tools, r.avaflow (i) employs a two-phase, interacting solid and fluid mixture model; (ii) is suitable for modelling more or less complex process chains and interactions; (iii) explicitly considers both entrainment and stopping i.e. the change of the basal topography; (iv) allows for the definition of multiple release masses and/or hydrographs; and (v) serves with built-in functionalities for validation, parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis. r.avaflow is freely available as a raster module of the GRASS GIS software, employing the programming languages Python and C along with the statistical software R. We exemplify the functionalities of r.avaflow by means of two sets of computational experiments: (1) generic process chains consisting in bulk mass and hydrograph release into a reservoir with entrainment of the dam and impact downstream; (2) the prehistoric Acheron rock avalanche, New Zealand. The simulation results are generally plausible for (1) and, after the optimization of two key parameters, reasonably in line with the corresponding observations for (2). However, we identify some potential to enhance the analytic and numerical concepts. Further, thorough parameter studies are necessary in order to make r.avaflow fit for reliable forward simulations of possible future mass flow events.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This paper investigates the level of satisfaction of students of the American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, with the walking environment of the university surroundings. This analysis is conducted by developing two structural equation models for estimating the causal relations between the level of satisfaction with the attributes of the walking environment and the level of satisfaction with the walking environment overall. The first model examines the sample of students who are frequent on-foot commuters, whereas the second model studies the remaining sampled students who typically conduct on-foot trips in the university surroundings for purposes other than commuting (shopping, eating, leisure, etc.). The resulting models indicate that specific neighborhood attributes have the greatest impact on the level of satisfaction with the walking environment for both samples, these attributes being the ease of pedestrian crossing, sidewalk blockage, cleanliness of sidewalk, vehicular traffic on streets and motorcycles going against traffic on one-way streets. Other attributes, such as the sidewalk width and quality and diversity of activities, are found to have no to little impact on the level of satisfaction of the two samples. Such findings may contribute to a better understanding of the walking environment in Beirut and aid in future policy interventions.},

abstract = {We describe methods for creating solar-reflective nonwhite surfaces and their application to a wide variety of residential roofing materials, including metal, clay tile, concrete tile, wood, and asphalt shingle. Reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum (0.7-2.5 ??m) is maximized by coloring a topcoat with pigments that weakly absorb and (optionally) strongly backscatter NIR radiation, and by adding an NIR-reflective basecoat (e.g., one colored with titanium dioxide rutile white) if both the topcoat and the substrate weakly reflect NIR radiation. Coated steel and glazed clay-tile roofing products achieved NIR reflectances of up to 0.50 and 0.75, respectively, using only cool topcoats. Gray-cement concrete tiles achieved NIR reflectances as high as 0.60 with coatings colored by NIR-scattering pigments. Such tiles could attain NIR reflectances of up to 0.85 by overlaying a white basecoat with a topcoat colored by NIR-transparent organic pigments. Granule-surfaced asphalt shingles achieved NIR reflectances as high as 0.45 when the granules were covered with a white basecoat and a cool color topcoat. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Walkability has been defined as the extent to which the urban environment is pedestrian friendly. By measuring it, planning professionals may be able to address the quality of the pedestrian environment, supporting more objective, effective and comprehensive walking-related strategies and interventions. This work presents a participatory framework for the assessment of walkability based on local circumstances and expertise, replicable on distinct urban contexts. The framework takes into account distinct pedestrian groups (adults, children, seniors and impaired mobility pedestrians) and trip purposes (utilitarian, leisure), expressing walkability in terms of seven key dimensions (7C's layout). From this conceptual framework, a methodology to evaluate walkability through GIS-based and street auditing indicators is presented. It was applied to an area in central Lisbon, Portugal, in order to evaluate the ease or difficulty that different types of pedestrians can face in their walking activities and, potentially, providing an insight for intervention and improvements. The results show clear differences in walkability scores for different pedestrian groups, namely between adults and seniors or impaired pedestrians. Besides, a validation of the results is presented by comparing street performance, as measured by our process, with home-based surveys conducted within the study area. Validation results confirm that the evaluation framework proposed is reliable in the representation of the pedestrian environment qualities as perceived by the public.},

abstract = {We assessed how small patches of contrasting urban ground cover [mesiscape (turf), xeriscape (gravel), concrete, and asphalt] altered the microclimate and performance of adjacent oleander (Nerium oleander L.) plants in Phoenix, Arizona during fall/winter (September-February) and spring/summer (March-September). Ground-cover and oleander canopy surface temperatures, canopy air temperatures and pot soil temperatures tended to be lowest in the mesiscape and highest in the asphalt and concrete. Canopy air vapor pressure deficits were lowest in the mesiscape and highest in the asphalt plot. Rates of net photosynthesis of all oleander plants were highest in October and May, and declined through mid-summer (June-July), when rates tended to be highest in the cooler mesiscape, particularly when water was limiting. During fall/winter, oleanders in the mesiscape produced 20{\%} less biomass, 13{\%} less leaf area, and had 12{\%} lower relative growth rates (R(G)) than those in the other ground covers. Lower nighttime temperatures in the mesiscape in December led to oleander frost damage. During spring/summer, oleanders in the mesiscape produced 11{\%} more biomass, 16{\%} more leaf area, and had 3{\%} higher R(G) than those in the other cover types. The effects of urban ground cover on oleander performance were season-specific; while oleander growth was greatest in the mesiscape during spring/summer, it was lowest during fall/winter and these plants experienced frost damage. Because all oleander plants produced {\textgreater}10 times as much biomass during the spring/summer, on an annual basis oleanders in the mesiscape produced 5-11{\%} more biomass than plants in the warmer ground covers.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pedestrian road trauma is significant in Australia and requires in-depth understanding to improve or inform new countermeasures. Analyses on single data sources can be limited. This study investigated demographic, behavioral, environmental, and collision characteristics of pedestrian injury in Victoria, Australia, over a 5-year period using multiple data sources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Victorian state police, hospital presentation, hospital admission, and coronial data sets were analyzed and compared for the years 2004 to 2008.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Analyses identified 3,702 police-recorded pedestrian casualties (deaths and injuries, of which 256 were deaths), 5,008 pedestrian traffic-related hospital presentations, and 2,802 pedestrian admissions. Trend analyses showed significant increases in police casualty and hospitalization rates per 100,000 population. Age groups most commonly involved were those aged 18-24 especially on weekends, 75+ especially on weekday days, and 13- to 17-year-olds especially at school commute times. Proportionally more cases were male in all data sets. One quarter of coroner-examined deaths involved alcohol and one third involved drugs. Two thirds of police-recorded casualties occurred on weekdays, and 45{\%} of weekend casualties occurred at night. Most casualties occurred in urban areas (95{\%}), in lower-speed zones (78{\%}); however, 79{\%} of rural casualties occurred in high-speed zones, of which more were fatal. Over half did not occur at intersections. The most common injuries were fractures as well as multiple injuries, which together with intracranial injuries, were most common among fatalities (50 and 34{\%}, respectively). Serious injury was more likely in older pedestrians, in males, in rural areas, in 60-80 km/h zones, in areas with poor lighting, while crossing a carriageway, not at an intersection, and when struck by a heavy vehicle.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate pedestrian serious injury rates are increasing and identify targets for countermeasures. Inherent limitations present in each relevant data collection require mutliple data sets to be explored and results contrasted. Jurisdictions seeking to determine pedestrian injury risk factors should aim to link police and hospital data for a complete analysis.},

abstract = {The evapotranspiration component, based on the Penman-Monteith equation, of the distributed Syst??me Hydrologique Europ??en (SHE) model of catchment hydrology is briefly described. The importance of evapotranspiration predictions to the operation of the model is stressed. However, such predictions may be expected to be in error and ideally it would be desirable to predict the error variance associated with estimates of evapotranspiration. This is not yet possible but the sensitivity of such estimates to errors in input data and estimated model parameter values can be investigated. It is shown that for dry canopy conditions at three sites within a broadly humid temperate region, the sensitivity of Penman-Monteith estimates of evapotranspiration to different input data and parameters is very dependent on the values of the aerodynamic and canopy resistance parameters that introduce the influence of vegetation type into the predictions. For forest surfaces in particular, the evapotranspiration predictions are highly sensitive to values of the canopy resistance, so that accurate estimation of this parameter is important. ?? 1979.},

abstract = {An extensive census and sampling program conducted in semiarid north-west New South Wales, Australia, has provided quantitative information on willy-willy (dust devils) characteristics and their environmental range. The observation of 557 willy-willies, made over a 20 day census period in summer, indicates that willy-willy frequency varies according to local meteorological conditions. An air temperature lapse rate, measured between 12 and 252 cm of the surface, of 0.9 ??C m-1 was required for the initiation of the willy-willies, with their frequency increasing with lapse rate away from the surface. Willy-willies were also found to be restricted to wind speeds between 1.5 and 7.5 m s-1. Analysis of the spatial distribution of willy-willy initiation sites with respect to vegetation cover in the 35 km2 study area showed that willy-willy frequency increases with decreasing surface cover. The increased frequency of willy-willies with decreasing vegetation, could, over time, make willy-willies a potent mechanism in the evolution of the Australian landscape. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{JoshDonlan2006,
abstract = {Large vertebrates are strong interactors in food webs, yet they were lost from most ecosystems after the dispersal of modern humans from Africa and Eurasia. We call for restoration of missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential of lost North American megafauna using extant conspecifics and related taxa. We refer to this restoration as Pleistocene rewilding; it is conceived as carefully managed ecosystem manipulations whereby costs and benefits are objectively addressed on a case-by-case and locality-by-locality basis. Pleistocene rewilding would deliberately promote large, long-lived species over pest and weed assemblages, facilitate the persistence and ecological effectiveness of megafauna on a global scale, and broaden the underlying premise of conservation from managing extinction to encompass restoring ecological and evolutionary processes. Pleistocene rewilding can begin immediately with species such as Bolson tortoises and feral horses and continue through the coming decades with elephants and Holarctic lions. Our exemplar taxa would contribute biological, economic, and cultural benefits to North America. Owners of large tracts of private land in the central and western United States could be the first to implement this restoration. Risks of Pleistocene rewilding include the possibility of altered disease ecology and associated human health implications, as well as unexpected ecological and sociopolitical consequences of reintroductions. Establishment of programs to monitor suites of species interactions and their consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem health will be a significant challenge. Secure fencing would be a major economic cost, and social challenges will include acceptance of predation as an overriding natural process and the incorporation of pre-Columbian ecological frameworks into conservation strategies.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the benefits of street greenery for creating thermally comfortable streetscapes in moderate climates. It reports on investigations on the impact of street greenery on outdoor thermal comfort from a physical and psychological perspective. For this purpose, we examined nine streets with comparable geometric configurations, but varying amount of street greenery (street trees, front gardens) in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. Mobile micrometeorological measurements including air temperature (T a), solar and thermal radiation were performed, enabling the calculation of mean radiant temperature (T mrt). Additionally, semi-structured interviews with pedestrians about their momentary and long-term perceived thermal comfort and their esthetical appreciation of the green street design were conducted. Measurements showed a clear impact (p =0.0001) of street greenery on thermal comfort through tree shading: 10{\%} tree crown cover within a street canyon lowered street averaged T mrt about 1K. In contrast, our results did not show an influence of street greenery on street averaged T a. Interview results indicated that momentary perceived thermal comfort tended to be related to the amount of street greenery. However, the results were not statistically significant. Related to long-term perceived thermal comfort respondents were hardly consciously aware of influences by street greenery. Yet, people significantly (p {\textless}0.001) valued the presence of street greenery in esthetic terms. In conclusion, street greenery forms a convenient adaptive strategy to create thermally comfortable and attractive living environments. Our results clearly indicate that both physical and psychological aspects of thermal comfort have to be considered in urban design processes.},

The most salient factors that emerged included the presence of other people, neighborhood surroundings, and safety from crime, followed by sidewalk and traffic conditions, animals, public walking tracks and trails, and weather.

abstract = {Transportation Research Board, 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20001, USA; Walking facilities are important infrastructures in communities. These facilities should be designed to accommodate the needs of all types of pedestrians. Unfortunately, existing design guidelines fail to offer adequate consideration for individuals with disabilities due to a lack of empirical data. To begin to fill that knowledge gap, a controlled large-scale research project was conducted at Utah State University (USU) to study the walking behavior of people with various types of disabilities in various walking facilities. These facilities include passageway, different types of angles (right and oblique), bottleneck, and stairwells. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to examine the impacts of individuals with disabilities on crowd walking speed and to study the impacts of different walking facilities on the movements of various pedestrian groups. Results show that the presence of individuals with disabilities in a crowd significantly reduces the crowd speed. Statistical analysis also reveals similarities and differences between the walking speeds of various pedestrian groups. A regression model is also calibrated to predict the speed of various types of pedestrians in different walking facilities. The findings of this paper may aid urban planners and walking facility designers in understanding the needs of people with low mobility.},

In this study we used an online survey to investigate the ways in which young, urban residents in Beijing, China use urban green spaces for physical activities. We analyzed the factors that affect the residents' satisfaction levels when participating in physical activities in urban green spaces by using ordinal logistic regression. Responses from the 1,062 survey participants indicated that low-intensity activities (e.g., walking, sightseeing) were the most common activities. The living context, quality of vegetation, and accessibility of urban green spaces had a significant effect on residents' satisfaction levels. For a compact city like Beijing, we recommended plans that focus on increasing the link among existing urban green spaces and improve the maintenance of residential green spaces in order to increase the use of urban green spaces for physical activities.},

@article{Fox2015a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Injuries among pedestrians are a major public health concern in Colombian cities such as Cali. This is one of the first studies in Latin America to apply Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) methods to visualize and produce fine-scale, highly accurate estimates of citywide pedestrian fatalities. The purpose of this study is to determine the BME method that best estimates pedestrian mortality rates and reduces statistical noise. We further utilized BME methods to identify and differentiate spatial patterns and persistent versus transient pedestrian mortality hotspots. METHODS: In this multiyear study, geocoded pedestrian mortality data from the Cali Injury Surveillance System (2008 to 2010) and census data were utilized to accurately visualize and estimate pedestrian fatalities. We investigated the effects of temporal and spatial scales, addressing issues arising from the rarity of pedestrian fatality events using 3 BME methods (simple kriging, Poisson kriging, and uniform model Bayesian maximum entropy). To reduce statistical noise while retaining a fine spatial and temporal scale, data were aggregated over 9-month incidence periods and censal sectors. Based on a cross-validation of BME methods, Poisson kriging was selected as the best BME method. Finally, the spatiotemporal and urban built environment characteristics of Cali pedestrian mortality hotspots were linked to intervention measures provided in Mead et al.'s (2014) pedestrian mortality review. RESULTS: The BME space-time analysis in Cali resulted in maps displaying hotspots of high pedestrian fatalities extending over small areas with radii of 0.25 to 1.1 km and temporal durations of 1 month to 3 years. Mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of pedestrian mortality rates identified high-priority areas for prevention strategies. The BME results allow us to identify possible intervention strategies according to the persistence and built environment of the hotspot; for example, through enforcement or long-term environmental modifications. CONCLUSIONS: BME methods provide useful information on the time and place of injuries and can inform policy strategies by isolating priority areas for interventions, contributing to intervention evaluation, and helping to generate hypotheses and identify the preventative strategies that may be suitable to those areas (e.g., street-level methods: pedestrian crossings, enforcement interventions; or citywide approaches: limiting vehicle speeds). This specific information is highly relevant for public health interventions because it provides the ability to target precise locations.},

abstract = {Diffuse downward shortwave irradiance at the surface arises from the scattering of radiation by molecules and aerosol particles. Recently, we reported that pyranometer-measuure diffuse solar irradiance in cloud-free atmospheres is overestimated by radiative transfer models at two low-altitude sites by an amount that exceeds modeling and measurement uncertainties but is correctly estimated within these uncertainties at two high-altitude sites [Halthore el al., 1998]. Here we explore this phenomenon in detail, with more cases and improved uncertainty analysis, confirming that the excess in modeled diffuse irradiance cannot be explained by uncertainties in measurements or aerosol-scattering properties that are input into the radiative transfer models or by errors in multiple-scattering schemes. The phenomenon is observed for all comparisons with data obtained intermittently over a 5-year period at the low-altitude sites. Model computations also exceed radiometer-measured sky radiance along the solar almucantar. Despite the inconsistencies between measured and modeled diffuse irradiance, atmospheric transmittance models correctly compute direct normal solar irradiance at all sites. These results indicate that at low altitudes a continuum atmospheric absorption process accounting for 0.022 +/- 0.01 in vertical optical thickness at 550 nm, corresponding to 4 +/- 2{\%} absorptance, may need to be included in radiative transfer models and in models that retrieve aerosol optical thickness from extinction measurements. This is a substantial excess absorption with major implications for climate modeling and weather forecasting. In remote sensing studies, neglect of this excess absorption would lead to substantial errors in satellite sensor calibration and satellite inferred top-of-atmosphere flux. An agent or process for this absorption has not yet been identified.},

abstract = {Objectives: To provide novel quantification and advanced measurements of surface temperatures (Ts) in playgrounds, employing multiple scales of data, and provide insight into hot-hazard mitigation techniques and designs for improved environmental and public health. Methods: We conduct an analysis of Ts in two Metro-Phoenix playgrounds at three scales: neighborhood (1km resolution), microscale (6.8m resolution), and touch-scale (1cm resolution). Data were derived from two sources: airborne remote sensing (neighborhood and microscale) and in situ (playground site) infrared Ts (touch-scale). Metrics of surface-to-air temperature deltas (??Ts-a) and scale offsets (errors) are introduced. Results: Select in situ Ts in direct sunlight are shown to approach or surpass values likely to result in burns to children at touch-scales much finer than Ts resolved by airborne remote sensing. Scale offsets based on neighbourhood and microscale ground observations are 3.8C and 7.3C less than the ??Ts-a at the 1cm touch-scale, respectively, and 6.6C and 10.1C lower than touch-scale playground equipment Ts, respectively. Hence, the coarser scales underestimate high Ts within playgrounds. Both natural (tree) and artificial (shade sail) shade types are associated with significant reductions in Ts. Conclusions: A scale mismatch exists based on differing methods of urban Ts measurement. The sub-meter touch-scale is the spatial scale at which data must be collected and policies of urban landscape design and health must be executed in order to mitigate high Ts in high-contact environments such as playgrounds. Shade implementation is the most promising mitigation technique to reduce child burns, increase park usability, and mitigate urban heating.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Measurement of the exchange of energy and mass between the surface and the atmospheric boundary-layer by the eddy covariance technique has undergone great change in the last two decades. Early studies of these exchanges were confined to brief field campaigns in carefully controlled conditions followed by months of data analysis. Current practice is to run tower-based eddy covariance systems continuously over several years due to the need for continuous monitoring as part of a global effort to develop local-, regional-, continental- and global-scale budgets of carbon, water and energy. Efficient methods of processing the increased quantities of data are needed to maximise the time available for analysis and interpretation. Standardised methods are needed to remove differences in data processing as possible contributors to observed spatial variability. Furthermore, public availability of these datasets assists with undertaking global research efforts. The OzFlux data path has been developed (i) to provide a standard set of quality control and post-processing tools across the network, thereby facilitating inter-site integration and spatial comparisons; (ii) to increase the time available to researchers for analysis and interpretation by reducing the time spent collecting and processing data; (iii) to propagate both data and metadata to the final product; and (iv) to facilitate the use of the OzFlux data by adopting a standard file format and making the data available from web-based portals. The fundamentals of the OzFlux data path include the adoption of netCDF as the underlying file format to integrate data and metadata, a suite of Python scripts to provide a standard quality control, post-processing, gap filling and partitioning environment, a portal from which data can be downloaded and an OPeNDAP server offering internet access to the latest version of the OzFlux data set. Discovery of the OzFlux data set is facilitated through incorporation in FluxNet data syntheses and the publication of collection metadata via the RIF-CS format. This paper serves two purposes. The first is to describe the datasets, along with their quality control and post-processing, for the other papers of this Special Issue. The second is to provide an example of one solution to the data collection and curation challenges that are encountered by similar flux tower networks worldwide.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Kaplan2007,
abstract = {Every leader gets off track from time to time. But as leaders rise through the ranks, they have fewer and fewer opportunities for honest and direct feedback. Their bosses are no longer monitoring their actions, and by the time management missteps have a negative impact on business results, it's usually too late to make course corrections that will set things right. Therefore, it is wise to go through a self-assessment, to periodically step back from the bustle of running a business and ask some key questions of yourself. Author Robert S. Kaplan, who during his 22-year career at Goldman Sachs chaired the firm's senior leadership training efforts and cochaired its partnership committee, identifies seven areas for self-reflection: vision and priorities, managing time, feedback, succession planning, evaluation and alignment, leading under pressure, and staying true to yourself. The author sets out a series of questions in each of the areas, illustrating the impact of self-assessment through vivid accounts of real executives. Although the questions sound simple, people are often shocked-even horrified- by their own answers. Executives are aware that they should be focusing on their most important priorities, for instance, but without stepping back to reflect, few actually know where they are allocating their time. Kaplan advocates writing down what you do every working hour for a week and checking how well your actions match up with your intentions. As for feedback, managers should ask themselves whether they're getting truthful evaluations from their subordinates. (In all likelihood, they aren't). It takes time and discipline to persuade your employees to tell you about your failings.},

abstract = {The mean radiant temperature, T(mrt), which sums up all shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes (both direct and reflected) to which the human body is exposed is one of the key meteorological parameters governing human energy balance and the thermal comfort of man. In this paper, a new radiation model (SOLWEIG 1.0), which simulates spatial variations of 3D radiation fluxes and T(mrt) in complex urban settings, is presented. The T(mrt) is derived by modelling shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes in six directions (upward, downward and from the four cardinal points) and angular factors. The model requires a limited number of inputs, such as direct, diffuse and global shortwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, urban geometry and geographical information (latitude, longitude and elevation). The model was evaluated using 7 days of integral radiation measurements at two sites with different building geometries--a large square and a small courtyard in G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden (57 degrees N)--across different seasons and in various weather conditions. The evaluation reveals good agreement between modelled and measured values of T(mrt), with an overall good correspondence of R (2) = 0.94, (p {\textless} 0.01, RMSE = 4.8 K). SOLWEIG 1.0 is still under development. Future work will incorporate a vegetation scheme, as well as an improvement of the estimation of fluxes from the four cardinal points.},

The perception of traffic hazards by pedestrians and the measures they take to reduce their exposure to risk is the subject of a growing body of literature. Among the factors shown to influence awareness of those hazards and to elicit behaviors avoiding or minimizing risk include the age of the pedestrian. Practices that may reduce the likelihood of pedestrian accidents. Participants were 571 pedestrians using one of four crosswalks in Edmonton Alberta, Canada, in October of 1986 and 1987. Only unaccompanied pedestrians presumably over the age of 17 were observed. Data were collected by four two-person observation teams extensively trained in observational techniques at four crosswalks on busy downtown streets with traffic passing through the intersections in four directions. Pieces of tape were placed unobtrusively on the sidewalk leading into the intersections at intervals of 1 foot or less from the curb, 2 feet from the curb, and 3 feet or beyond. This study reaffirmed the finding that older adults and women were both more cognizant of traffic hazards and more likely to exercise caution as pedestrians. The elderly may realize that they are at greater risk of being involved in a fatal accident than younger pedestrians.},

@article{Chen2008,
abstract = {Simple but realistic modeling of radiation transfer within heterogeneous canopy has been a challenging research question for decades and is critical for predicting ecological processes such as photosynthesis. The Markov model proposed by [Nilson, T., 1971. A theoretical analysis of the frequency of gaps in plant stands. Agric. Meteorol. 8, 25-38] is theoretically sound to meet this challenge. However, it has not been widely used because of the difficulty of determining the clumping factor. We propose an analytical approach to calculate clumping factors based on the average characteristics of vegetation distributed across a landscape. In a savanna woodland in California, we simulate the photosynthesis of the landscape in three different ways: (1) the crown envelope and location of each tree is spatially explicitly specified, (2) the canopy is assumed to be horizontally homogeneous within which leaves are randomly dispersed as a Poisson process, and (3) the canopy is horizontally homogeneous but leaves are clumped and distributed with a Markov process. We find that the Markov model can achieve much better performance than the Poisson model by incorporating the crown-level clumping. The results indicate that our approach of calculating clumping factors has applications in terrestrial ecosystem modeling, particularly where accurate representation of "system heterogeneity" (e.g., savannas and woodlands) is required. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The potential environmental and health benefits of active transportation modes (e.g. walking and cycling) have led to considerable research on the influence of the built environment on travel. This paper presents the findings of a study combining environmental audits and a survey-based respondent mapping tool to test the influence of micro-scale built environment characteristics, including 'green street' storm water management features, on resident perceptions of walking environment attractiveness. Results suggest that this method is sensitive enough to unpack a concept like walkability into individual component characteristics. Findings from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model indicate that in a predominantly single-family residential context well-designed green street facilities, as well as other features such as parks, separation from vehicle traffic, and pedestrian network connectivity can significantly contribute to walking environment attractiveness. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Lee2015,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test whether a compact neighborhood design is associated with trip-chaining behavior. Trip chaining is regarded as a growing phenomenon in travel and activity behavior because people seek to minimize the travel time and cost required to accomplish their daily activities based on the available time budget and other needs. In this study, trip-chaining patterns were examined over a survey day, giving insight into the association between land use and the planning of the trip and its distance, as well as the preferred mode of transportation. A tour consists of a combination of individual trips, including all of the stops that are made along the way. A series of multivariate models was used separately for different types of tours segmented into simple (one destination) and complex (more than one destination), and into work and nonwork tours. The results confirmed the idea that trip chaining diminishes the likelihood of using nonmotorized modes of transportation. In addition, local land use and walkability have a limited effect on work-related tours, but these factors are significantly related to nonwork tours. A resident who lives in a more walkable neighborhood is likely to take simple, albeit more frequent nonwork tours and conduct their nonwork activities on foot or by public transport, which reduces their use of vehicles during the day. These findings lead to the conclusion that there is more opportunity to use urban design policies to influence nonwork tours than work tours.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between diversity and stability requires a knowledge of how species interact with each other and how each is affected by the environment. The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

abstract = {The transpirational cooling of vegetation as a measure to mitigate outdoor air temperatures was investigated for a street canyon in the city center of Arnhem, the Netherlands for the meteorological conditions of an afternoon hour on a hot summer day during a heat wave with wind of speed 5.1ms-1 at 10m above ground and direction along the canyon. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with locally applied vegetation in the street, i.e. avenue-trees, facade greening, roof greening and all three combined, were performed. The 3D steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were closed by the realizable k-?? turbulence model extended with source and sink terms to represent the effects of vegetation on air flow. By specifying a cooling power term in the energy equation, the transpirational cooling by vegetation was accounted for. The strongest cooling by a single vegetative measure was obtained with the avenue-trees with mean and maximum temperature reductions at pedestrian level of 0.43??C and 1.6??C, respectively. Facade greening resulted in rather small changes with mean and maximum reductions of 0.04??C and 0.3??C, respectively. For roof greening no noticeable reductions inside the canyon were found. In the case of a combination of all vegetative measures, cooling in terms of spatial distribution and intensity overall resembled a linear superposition of those of the vegetative measures solely applied with 0.52??C mean and 2.0??C maximum temperature reduction. Overall, the cooling was restricted to the vicinity of the vegetative measures, i.e. up to a distance of a few meters.},

The results were compared with the outcome of a computation using synoptic data, not only from Austria but also from surrounding countries. The mean radiant temperature, an important factor in the energy balance of humans, was calculated using the well established RayMan model. It was determined on the basis of the maximum possible global radiation to a certain time and place, and the existing mean cloud cover from the observations of the climatic network, as well as those computed for current conditions. Statistical and GIS procedures were applied to the PET computation of the single climatic station in order to transfer the point into aerial values. The results give fundamental information often demanded by health, recreation, and tourism authorities. KEYWORDS:},

abstract = {Soil-surface CO2 efflux and its spatial and temporal variations were examined in an 8-y-old ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California from June 1998 to August 1999. Continuous measurements of soil CO2 efflux, soil temperatures and moisture were conducted on two 20 × 20 m sampling plots. Microbial biomass, fine root biomass, and the physical and chemical properties of the soil were also measured at each of the 18 sampling locations on the plots. It was found that the mean soil CO2 efflux in the plantation was 4.43 µmol m−2 s−1 in the growing season and 3.12 µmol m−2 s−1 in the nongrowing season. These values are in the upper part of the range of published soil-surface CO2 efflux data. The annual maximum and minimum CO2 efflux were 5.87 and 1.67 µmol m−2 s−1, respectively, with the maximum occurring between the end of May and early June and the minimum in December. The diurnal fluctuation of CO2 efflux was relatively small ({\textless} 20{\%}) with the minimum appearing around 09.00 hours and the maximum around 14.00 hours. Using daytime measurements of soil CO2 efflux tends to overestimate the daily mean soil CO2 efflux by 4–6{\%}. The measurements taken between 09.00 and 11.00 hours (local time) seem to better represent the daily mean with a reduced sampling error of 0.9–1.5{\%}. The spatial variation of soil CO2 efflux among the 18 sampling points was high, with a coefficient of variation of approximately 30{\%}. Most (84{\%}) of the spatial variation was explained by fine root biomass, microbial biomass, and soil physical and chemical properties. Although soil temperature and moisture explained most of the temporal variations (76–95{\%}) of soil CO2 efflux, the two variables together explained less than 34{\%} of the spatial variation. Microbial biomass, fine root biomass, soil nitrogen content, organic matter content, and magnesium content were significantly and positively correlated with soil CO2 efflux, whereas bulk density and pH value were negatively correlated with CO2 efflux. The relationship between soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature was significantly controlled by soil moisture with a Q10 value of 1.4 when soil moisture was {\textless}14{\%} and 1.8 when soil moisture was {\textgreater}14{\%}. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations is essential to accurately assessment of carbon budget at whole ecosystem and landscape scales. Thus, this study bears important implications for the study of large-scale ecosystem dynamics, particularly in response to climatic variations and management regimes.},

@article{Bijoor2014a,
abstract = {The fate of irrigation in urban ecosystems is highly uncertain, due to uncertainties in urban ecohydrology. We compared irrigation rates, soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), stomatal conductance, and water budgets of landscape ecosystems managed with different turfgrass species and irrigation technologies. The “Typical” landscape had a cool-season fescue and was irrigated by an automatic timer. The “Alternative1” landscape had a warm-season paspalum and a “smart” soil moisture sensor-based irrigation system. The “Alternative2” landscape had a cool-season native sedge and a “smart” weather station-based drip irrigation system. ET was measured with a portable closed chamber and modeled using a Penman-Monteith approach, and the two methods agreed well. The water applied to the Alternative1 was 54 {\%} less than the water applied to the Typical landscape, and the water applied to the Alternative2 was 24 {\%} less. Soil moisture was similar in the Typical and Alternative2, while Alternative1 was drier in spring. The stomatal conductance of sedge was lower than the other two species, but its ET was not lower due to higher leaf area. Irrigation efficiencies (ET/applied irrigation) were 57 - 58 {\%}, 86 – 97 {\%}, and 78 - 80 {\%} for the Typical, Alternative1, and Alternative2 landscapes, respectively. Runoff was less than 2 {\%} in each landscape, and excess irrigation primarily drained below the root zone. Differences in irrigation efficiency between landscapes were due mainly to irrigation application, which varied more than species water use. Smart irrigation systems provided substantial water savings relative to a timer-based system, and prevented significant drainage losses. The utilization of smart sensors was more important than the choice of turfgrass species for irrigation efficiency.},

@article{Patel2013,
abstract = {Environmental heat illness and injuries are a serious concern for the Army and Marines. Currently, the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index is used to evaluate heat injury risk. The index is a weighted average of dry-bulb temperature (Tdb), black globe temperature (Tbg), and natural wet-bulb temperature (Tnwb). The WBGT index would be more widely used if it could be determined using standard weather instruments. This study compares models developed by Liljegren at Argonne National Laboratory and by Matthew at the U.S. Army Institute of Environmental Medicine that calculate WBGT using standard meteorological measurements. Both models use air temperature (Ta), relative humidity, wind speed, and global solar radiation (RG) to calculate Tnwb and Tbg. The WBGT and meteorological data used for model validation were collected at Griffin, Georgia and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona. Liljegren (YPG: R(2) = 0.709, p {\textless} 0.01; Griffin: R(2) = 0.854, p {\textless} 0.01) showed closer agreement between calculated and actual WBGT than Matthew (YPG: R(2) = 0.630, p {\textless} 0.01; Griffin: R(2) = 0.677, p {\textless} 0.01). Compared to actual WBGT heat categorization, the Matthew model tended to underpredict compared to Liljegren's classification. Results indicate Liljegren is an acceptable alternative to direct WBGT measurement, but verification under other environmental conditions is needed.},

@article{Buscail2012,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Climate change poses unprecedented challenges, ranging from global and local policy challenges to personal and social action. Heat-related deaths are largely preventable, but interventions for the most vulnerable populations need improvement. Therefore, the prior identification of high risk areas at the community level is required to better inform planning and prevention. We aimed to demonstrate a simple and flexible conceptual framework relying upon satellite thermal data and other digital data with the goal of easily reproducing this framework in a variety of urban configurations. RESULTS: The study area encompasses Rennes, a medium-sized French city. A Landsat ETM + image (60 m resolution) acquired during a localized heatwave (June 2001) was used to estimate land surface temperature (LST) and derive a hazard index. A land-use regression model was performed to predict the LST. Vulnerability was assessed through census data describing four dimensions (socio-economic status, extreme age, population density and building obsolescence). Then, hazard and vulnerability indices were combined to deliver a heatwave health risk index. The LST patterns were quite heterogeneous, reflecting the land cover mosaic inside the city boundary, with hotspots of elevated temperature mainly observed in the city center. A spatial error regression model was highly predictive of the spatial variation in the LST (R2 = 0.87) and was parsimonious. Three land cover descriptors (NDVI, vegetation and water fractions) were negatively linked with the LST. A sensitivity analysis (based on an image acquired on July 2000) yielded similar results. Southern areas exhibited the most vulnerability, although some pockets of higher vulnerability were observed northeast and west of the city. The heatwave health risk map showed evidence of infra-city spatial clustering, with the highest risks observed in a north--south central band. Another sensitivity analysis gave a very high correlation between 2000 and 2001 risk indices (r = 0.98, p {\textless} 10-12). CONCLUSIONS: Building on previous work, we developed a reproducible method that can provide guidance for local planners in developing more efficient climate impact adaptations. We recommend, however, using the health risk index together with hazard and vulnerability indices to implement tailored programs because exposure to heat and vulnerability do not require the same prevention strategies.},

@article{Bolleter2014,
abstract = { Twenty-one years have elapsed between an international design competition held for the redesign of Perth's Swan River foreshore and the commencement of construction of a small, but significant, section of the this river's edge. This extended period of design proposition allows an opportunity to reflect on trends in waterfront design in Perth, and shifting notions of what Perth is, and could be, as expressed by the proposals. Trends identified include a growing appreciation of urban values, increasing aspirations to produce symbolic capital, increasing production of stylized urban imagery and the corresponding dominance of the architectural discipline. Perth's foreshore has been until recently a vast expanse of typically unoccupied, turfed parkland. Analogous to a scaled-up suburban ‘front yard', its role has been typically symbolic rather than functional. As such, schemes for the redesign of this foreshore, and subsequent public reactions, also tend to reveal aspects of Perth's collective identity. While the 1991 competition-winning scheme recreated a naturalistic landscape on the foreshore, later state government-endorsed schemes in 2008 and 2011 proposed the urbanization of the foreshore at significant densities. These recent schemes reflect, and have forged, a growing desire for urbanity in Perth. },

@article{Newton2012,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The R project includes a large variety of packages designed for spatial statistics. Google dynamic maps provide web based access to global maps and satellite imagery. We describe a method for displaying directly the spatial output from an R script on to a Google dynamic map. METHODS: This is achieved by creating a Java based web application which runs the R script and then displays the results on the dynamic map. In order to make this method easy to implement by those unfamiliar with programming Java based web applications, we have added the method to the options available in the R Web User Interface (Rwui) application. Rwui is an established web application for creating web applications for running R scripts. A feature of Rwui is that all the code for the web application being created is generated automatically so that someone with no knowledge of web programming can make a fully functional web application for running an R script in a matter of minutes. RESULTS: Rwui can now be used to create web applications that will display the results from an R script on a Google dynamic map. Results may be displayed as discrete markers and/or as continous overlays. In addition, users of the web application may select regions of interest on the dynamic map with mouse clicks and the coordinates of the region of interest will automatically be made available for use by the R script. CONCLUSIONS: This method of displaying R output on dynamic maps is designed to be of use in a number of areas. Firstly it allows statisticians, working in R and developing methods in spatial statistics, to easily visualise the results of applying their methods to real world data. Secondly, it allows researchers who are using R to study health geographics data, to display their results directly onto dynamic maps. Thirdly, by creating a web application for running an R script, a statistician can enable users entirely unfamiliar with R to run R coded statistical analyses of health geographics data. Fourthly, we envisage an educational role for such applications.},

abstract = {The use of urban vegetation in cities is a common landscape planning strategy to alleviate the heat island effect as well as to enhance building energy efficiency. The presence of trees in street canyons can effectively reduce environmental temperature via radiative shading. However, resolving shade trees in urban land surface models presents a major challenge in numerical models, especially in predicting the radiative heat exchange in canyons. In this paper, we develop a new numerical framework by incorporating shade trees into an advanced single-layer urban canopy model. This novel numerical framework is applied to Phoenix metropolitan area to investigate the cooling effect of different urban vegetation types and their potentials in saving building energy. It is found that the cooling effect by shading from trees is more significant than that by evapotranspiration from lawns, leading to a considerable saving of cooling load. In addition, analysis of human thermal comfort shows that urban vegetation plays a crucial role in creating a comfortable living environment, especially for cities located in arid or semi-arid region.},

abstract = {Outer-suburban housing estates dominate new house constructions in Australia, and are a major contributor current and future environmental impacts such as water, waste and greenhouse gas emissions (Blair et al. 2003). Typically houses in these estates are built without an in-depth consideration of ecological sustainability factors. Program interventions aimed at promoting more sustainable practices have typically involved the dissemination of information materials, such as the ‘Your Home' design guide, or the development of demonstration ‘eco-homes', the most notable example being the ACF Greenhome completed in 1993. There is little evidence to suggest that these programs have had any substantive impact on mainstream housing developments (Okraglik 1995). EcoHome is a three-year cross-disciplinary research study into what sustainability outcomes are possible for the industry using existing design methods and technologies, including design, technical and sociological research. Each research stream, and its strategy have been selected to address specific barriers to the mainstreaming of more sustainable homebuilding practices in Australia. The research is based around a new demonstration eco-house at the Estate of Cairnlea in Melbourne's outer west. Outcomes of the research will assist the housing aznd land development industry achieve more sustainable outcomes at the forthcoming 8500 home Aurora Estate to be constructed on the northern fringe of metropolitan Melbourne. This paper outlines the rationale and core methodologies of the project, focussing on the need for inter-disciplinary research both in the context of the outer- urban housing industry and sustainability more generally.},

This article presents a methodology that addressesthis question by examining the correlation between built environment along commuting routes and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and fuel consumption for nonwork automobile travel. Using a global positioning systems (GPS) data set collected from automobile trips of 46 drivers from the southeast Michigan area over a 30-day time frame, this study identifies the actual commuting routes for all drivers and derives theirfuel consumption for nonwork travel. Although statistically significant relationships are not found between route environments and nonwork VMT and fuel consumption, this study is unique in its focus on the commuting routes and in establishing a methodology for using GPS data in transportation and land-use research, and it offers suggestions for refining the modeling of travel behavior along commuting routes. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Private yards provide city residents with access to ecosystem services that can be realized through passive (vegetation availability) and active (time spent in yards: frequency and duration) means. However, urban densification is leading to smaller yards with less vegetation. Here, we examine how urban form and socio-demographic factors affect the potential ecosystem service benefits people can gain via passive (e.g. climate regulation) and active (e.g. recreation) pathways. Two measures of vegetation cover (0.15–2 m, {\textgreater}2 m) are used as a proxy for passive ecosystem service benefits, and two measures of yard use (use frequency, total time spent across a week) are used for active ecosystem service benefits. We use survey and GIS data to measure personal and physical predictors that could influence these variables for 520 residents of detached housing in Brisbane, Australia. We found house age and yard size were positively correlated with vegetation cover, and people with a greater nature relatedness and lower socio-economic disadvantage also had greater vegetation cover. Yard size was an important predictor of yard use, as was nature relatedness, householder age, and presence of children in the home. Vegetation cover showed no relationship, indicating that greater cover alone does not promote ecosystem service delivery through the active use pathway. Together our results show that people who have higher nature relatedness may receive greater benefits from their yards via both passive and active means as they have more vegetation available to them in their yards and they interact with this space more frequently and for longer time periods.},

abstract = {Streets represent a significant part of the public space in urban areas and cater to our functional, social and leisure needs. The biggest competitive advantage of the neighbourhood commercial street is its ability to support social interaction as a part of the daily routine. Numerous characteristics have been previously associated with good urban design of the street. This paper emphasizes the need for researchers to view the experience of the street especially from the users' perspective. Using extensive behaviour mapping and user interviews this paper focuses on identifying the specific characteristics that support social interaction on neighbourhood commercial streets. The findings expand our understanding of what we consider the realm of design and suggest specific physical and land-use characteristics, and their management that are important in supporting social interaction on neighbourhood commercial streets.},

abstract = {The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) is developed$\backslash$nto include snow. The processes addressed include accumulation of snow on$\backslash$nthe different urban surface types: snow albedo and density aging, snow$\backslash$nmelting and re-freezing of meltwater. Individual model parameters are$\backslash$nassessed and independently evaluated using long-term observations in the$\backslash$ntwo cold climate cities of Helsinki and Montreal. Eddy covariance$\backslash$nsensible and latent heat fluxes and snow depth observations are$\backslash$navailable for two sites in Montreal and one in Helsinki. Surface runoff$\backslash$nfrom two catchments (24 and 45 ha) in Helsinki and snow properties$\backslash$n(albedo and density) from two sites in Montreal are also analysed. As$\backslash$nmultiple observation sites with different land-cover characteristics are$\backslash$navailable in both cities, model development is conducted independent of$\backslash$nevaluation. The developed model simulates snowmelt related runoff well$\backslash$n(within 19{\%} and 3{\%} for the two catchments in Helsinki when there is$\backslash$nsnow on the ground), with the springtime peak estimated correctly.$\backslash$nHowever, the observed runoff peaks tend to be smoother than the$\backslash$nsimulated ones, likely due to the water holding capacity of the$\backslash$ncatchments and the missing time lag between the catchment and the$\backslash$nobservation point in the model. For all three sites the model simulates$\backslash$nthe timing of the snow accumulation and melt events well, but$\backslash$nunderestimates the total snow depth by 18-20{\%} in Helsinki and 29-33{\%}$\backslash$nin Montreal. The model is able to reproduce the diurnal pattern of net$\backslash$nradiation and turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat during cold$\backslash$nsnow, melting snow and snow-free periods. The largest model$\backslash$nuncertainties are related to the timing of the melting period and the$\backslash$nparameterization of the snowmelt. The results show that the enhanced$\backslash$nmodel can simulate correctly the exchange of energy and water in cold$\backslash$nclimate cities at sites with varying surface cover.},

For this catchment, the mean annual rainfall was found to be three times greater than imported potable water, and the sum of the output from the separate stormwater and wastewater systems exceeded the input of imported potable water by some 50{\%}. Seasonal and annual variations in climate exert a very strong influence over the relative magnitude of the water balance components; this needs to be accounted for when assessing the potential for utilizing stormwater and wastewater within an urban catchment.},

abstract = {Species invasions provide numerous unplanned and frequently, but imperfectly, replicated experiments that can be used to better understand the natural world. Classic studies by Darwin, Grinnell, Elton and others on these species-invasion experiments provided invaluable insights for ecology and evolutionary biology. Recent studies of invasions have resulted in additional insights, six of which we discuss here; these insights highlight the utility of using exotic species as 'model organisms'. We also discuss a nascent hypothesis that might provide a more general, predictive understanding of invasions and community assembly. Finally, we emphasize how the study of invasions can help to inform our understanding of applied problems, such as extinction, ecosystem function and the response of species to climate change.},

abstract = {The project concerns a sustainable residential block in the new “Gluckstein Quartier” development in Mannheim, Germany, which offers a methodology of considering sustainable issues throughout the design process, especially from the architects' point of view. It is a walkable community consists of approximately 150 homes in a mixture of one-, two- and three- bedroom apartments, family houses and SOHOs(Small Office Home Office), providing a balanced community. The issue that we are facing today in the building the sustainable neighborhood is dynamic, which not just includes current performance, but also future effects; and complex which includes environmental stewardship, economic growth and social progress. In this situation, the arrangement of the block should be designed to be flexible and in order to meet changing needs and future developments in living patterns. Developing a sense of community ownership also plays an important role in building a sustainable neighborhood and should be listed in the design strategy. The concept of “Microclimate” is established to describe the meteorological conditions for specific locations and their direct surroundings. It affects the climate inside a building and the comfortable of human well- being, and protects buildings against undesirable climate effect. The strategies of controlling and making use of the climate elements should be considered before designing a specific landscape or building. As for a specific building or unit, sustainability exists in all the stages of design process, from the arrangement of the usage orientation to the consideration of the heated areas, from the collection of rain water to the use of solar energy, from the choosing the heating resource to the comparing the effects of shading systems, etc. The project is meaningful for us, but there is a more important thing—the methodology we try to find out. It is not just about present but also future.},

abstract = {The present study was aimed to investigate how and to what extent urban land surface temperature (ULST) is affected by spatial pattern of green cover patch in an urban ambient in Isfahan, Iran. To materialize the effects of spatial pattern of green cover on ULST, Landsat ETM+image data on May 5, 2002 was acquired to be processed for ULST estimation and to generate Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classes. Given to five percent of total available cells with a randomized distribution across the built-up areas, the linkage between ULST and composition, configuration and structure of green cover class was quantified. Five patch level landscape metrics including nearest distance (ND), patch area (AREA), perimeter to area (PARA), shape index (SHAPE) and core area index (CAI) were chosen and applied as explaining variables in statistical analyses due to their potential effects on ULST. Results of the present study have revealed that all the landscape metrics values of the green cover class were significantly correlated to their nearest ULST sample points, amongst which a stronger linkage was observed between ND (r=0.611, p {\textless}0.05) and ULST compared to others. Stepwise generalized additive modeling method-based multiple linear re- gression model was then fitted to dataset and resulted in developing the model (r2= 0.41, p {\textless}0.05), explaining the relationship between spatial pattern of green cover and ULST. Finally, we concluded that the present study could provide additional level of knowledge through which urban planners can optimize composition, configuration and structure of green cover patches to mitigate the adverse impacts of LST phenomenon especially where urbanization is still ongoing.},

abstract = {Outdoor thermal comfort affects the health of the people and the quality of life in urban areas. This is the reason why in the past few years different mitigation strategies for the microclimate have been studied and examined. These strategies depend on those passive factors characterizing the urban setting that are able to affect the values of local meteorological variables, as the limit surfaces of the urban space (parterre and fa{\c{c}}ades of the buildings). This paper examines the Cloister by Giuliano da Sangallo, which is part of the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. The case study compares the present configuration of the Cloister with four other configurations characterized by some vegetation and materials with a high albedo by taking into consideration the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model. Microclimatic variables are calculated through numerical simulations performed by the ENVI-met software. Such a comparison is performed during a typical summer day. While examining the results it can be noticed how the strategy presenting the best results is the one with some vegetation, whereas the materials with a high albedo improve the microclimate if applied on surfaces characterized by a high sky view factor.},

This paper provides an overview of the underlying algorithms and methods that constitute the multi-node dynamic UTCI-Fiala model of human thermal physiology and comfort. Treated topics include modelling heat and mass transfer within the body, numerical techniques, modelling environmental heat exchanges, thermoregulatory reactions of the central nervous system, and perceptual responses. Other contributions of this special issue describe the validation of the UTCI-Fiala model against measured data and the development of the adaptive clothing model for outdoor climates.},

GA4.0 and GL4.0 are based on the previous GA3.0 and GL3.0 configurations, with the inclusion of developments made by the Met Office and its collaborators during its annual development cycle. This paper provides a comprehensive technical and scientific description of GA4.0 and GL4.0 as well as details of how these differ from their predecessors. We also present the results of some initial evaluations of their performance. Overall, performance is comparable with that of GA3.0/GL3.0; the updated configurations include improvements to the science of several parametrisation schemes, however, and will form a baseline for further ongoing development.},

@article{Bernacchi2001,
abstract = {Predicting the environmental responses of leaf photosynthesis is central to many models of changes in the future global carbon cycle and terrestrial biosphere. The steady-state biochemical model of C-3 photosynthesis of Farquhar et al. (Planta 149, 78-90, 1980) provides a basis for these larger scale predictions; but a weakness in the application of the model as currently parameterized is the inability to accurately predict carbon assimilation at the range of temperatures over which significant photosynthesis occurs in the natural environment. The temperature functions used in this model have been based on in vitro measurements made over a limited temperature range and require several assumptions of in vivo conditions. Since photosynthetic rates are often Rubisco-limited (ribulose, 1-5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) under natural steady-state conditions, inaccuracies in the functions predicting Rubisco kinetic properties at different temperatures may cause significant error. In this study, transgenic tobacco containing only 10{\%} normal levels of Rubisco were used to measure Rubisco-limited photosynthesis over a large range of CO2 concentrations. From the responses of the rate of CO2 assimilation at a wide range of temperatures, and CO2 and O-2 concentrations, the temperature functions of Rubisco kinetic properties were estimated in vivo. These differed substantially from previously published functions. These new functions were then used to predict photosynthesis in lemon and found to faithfully mimic the observed pattern of temperature response. There was also a close correspondence with published C-3 photosynthesis temperature responses. The results represent an improved ability to model leaf photosynthesis over a wide range of temperatures (10-40 degreesC) necessary for predicting carbon uptake by terrestrial C-3 systems.},

abstract = {We tested in two corresponding studies the hypothesis that urban gardening is of visual aesthetic value to the public. With the help of photo-realistic visualizations and a written questionnaire, 109 students and employees of the Karlsruhe University of Education (study 1) and 200 passers-by in the city of Karlsruhe (study 2) were asked about their opinion on different urban gardening scenarios, and attitudes towards urban gardening. Our results indicate that urban gardening can contribute to perceived attractiveness of urban areas, but that not all approaches are perceived as equally positive. While flowerbeds or flower meadows and orderly-managed vegetable plots, in comparison to conventional lawns, increased the aesthetic appeal of urban green space, container gardening approaches, which were often characterized as chaotic, did not. Although flower scenarios were preferred over vegetable scenarios, participants were rather positive about the idea of having more vegetable plots around. Socio-demographic variables had only minor influences on preferences and attitudes. As people were fonder of flowerbeds or flower meadows than of vegetable plots, a mixture of both might be advisable in urban gardening sites. This would also increase overall diversity, which is not only beneficial from an aesthetic, but also from an ecological point of view.},

abstract = {In Brazil, the semi-arid tropical zone comprises approximately 12{\%} of its territory. In this region the Caatinga is the only exclusively Brazilian biome. Nonetheless, there is a lack of knowledge about its structure and functioning. This study aimed at assessing the effective depth of the root system of the preserved Caatinga biome, as well as its temporal and spatial variation. To this end, 72 soil proﬁles were evaluated, both in the dry and rainy seasons, including three soils (Acrisol, Luvisol and Regosol) and four proﬁles per trench, with three replications. The results showed that the effective depth of the Caatinga roots range from 0.60 m to 0.78 m in non-restrictive deep soils, three times smaller than values commonly used in hydrological models. Vegetation adapted to shallow soils, presenting effective root depth as low as 0.36 m. The effective depth of the roots showed spatial homogeneity, for each soil- vegetation association, regardless of the proximity of large trees. It was also observed that the root depth in the dry season is, on average, 10 cm shorter than that of the rainy season. This can indicate an adaptation strategy, generating soil secondary porosity to enhance inﬁltration in the root zone.},

abstract = {A most important and special element of urban environment is city centre which is normally viewed as an identity of a city because of concentrated buildings and intensive services. Thus it is extremely important to keep pedestrian spaces in city centres of metropolises integrated and continual, but hard to achieve especially where road resources on the ground are crowded by vehicles for the efficiency. As compensation of urban pedestrian systems on the street level, underground pedestrian systems and skywalk systems not only extend the realm of pedestrians, providing a safer and more convenient walking environment, but also save land resources for more compact and sustainable city construction. This paper provides a first step to standardise the way we look at underground pedestrian systems in the context of walkable cities. It draws together research on walkable cities and underground pedestrian networks to illustrate how better integration of underground pedestrian networks with urban pedestrian systems can be achieved. It reviews the influencing factors of underground pedestrian systems to guide the planning of an integrated pedestrian network that incorporates underground pedestrian systems. The paper paves the way for the collection of more detailed primary data on the decisive effects of those influencing factors to reach a better understanding of how underground pedestrian systems are affected by pedestrian usage, spatial activity patterns, the transportation system and urban design.},

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) initiated and directed the meta-analysis of 16 observational studies dated 1987-1998. This examination concentrates on injury to the brain and shows that the meta-analysis and its included studies take no account of scientific knowledge of its mechanisms. Consequently, the choice of studies for the meta-analysis and the collection, treatment and interpretation of their data lack the guidance needed to distinguish injuries caused through fracture of the skull and by angular acceleration. It is shown that the design of helmets reflects a discredited theory of brain injury. The conclusions are that the meta-analysis does not provide scientific evidence that such helmets reduce serious injury to the brain, and the Australian policy of compulsory wearing lacks a basis of verified efficacy against brain injury.},

@article{Brode2012a,
abstract = {The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) aimed for a one-dimensional quantity adequately reflecting the human physiological reaction to the multi-dimensionally defined actual outdoor thermal environment. The human reaction was simulated by the UTCI-Fiala multi-node model of human thermoregulation, which was integrated with an adaptive clothing model. Following the concept of an equivalent temperature, UTCI for a given combination of wind speed, radiation, humidity and air temperature was defined as the air temperature of the reference environment, which according to the model produces an equivalent dynamic physiological response. Operationalising this concept involved (1) the definition of a reference environment with 50{\%} relative humidity (but vapour pressure capped at 20 hPa), with calm air and radiant temperature equalling air temperature and (2) the development of a one-dimensional representation of the multivariate model output at different exposure times. The latter was achieved by principal component analyses showing that the linear combination of 7 parameters of thermophysiological strain (core, mean and facial skin temperatures, sweat production, skin wettedness, skin blood flow, shivering) after 30 and 120 min exposure time accounted for two-thirds of the total variation in the multi-dimensional dynamic physiological response. The operational procedure was completed by a scale categorising UTCI equivalent temperature values in terms of thermal stress, and by providing simplified routines for fast but sufficiently accurate calculation, which included look-up tables of pre-calculated UTCI values for a grid of all relevant combinations of climate parameters and polynomial regression equations predicting UTCI over the same grid. The analyses of the sensitivity of UTCI to humidity, radiation and wind speed showed plausible reactions in the heat as well as in the cold, and indicate that UTCI may in this regard be universally useable in the major areas of research and application in human biometeorology.},

abstract = {Nowadays, climatology, thermal comfort, and walkability have already become the main issues of some researches in an urban context in the term to make urban area to be easier to live in. The people' awareness of open space and green area is emergent as well in order to provide opportunities for people interaction, physical exercise and leisure especially for the children and the elderly. One proposed definition for a better place in the open space is the extent to which outdoor space is friendly to the presence of people activity. In the tropical hot-humid climate, outdoor spaces are used during the year, and they must provide proper levels of thermal comfort. This study was carried out in Jakarta (Indonesia) with the aim of discovering, through these indices, the natural and ecological effects of urban design which can improve thermal comfort and walkability. The result shows thermal comfort is difficult to achieve in the open space among buildings of superblock in Jakarta. The heat trapped among the buildings in the night time affect the temperature in the morning made Tmrt (radiation) raise significantly in the day. Tmrt did not only affect the thermal comfort in open space but also affect the walkability. The simulation result that the people mileage of walking is affected by Tmrt. Shadowing is needed in the term of Thermal Comfort and Walkability in open space of Superblock.},

abstract = {To evaluate the effect of vehicle type (passenger vehicle vs. light truck vehicle) on crash trajectory and on the consequent source and severity of pedestrian injury, we analyzed data from the Pedestrian Crash Data Study (PCDS), conducted by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) from 1994 to 1998. While 62{\%} of the adults in PV (passenger vehicle)-related crashes were carried by the vehicle, such pedestrian-vehicle interaction was observed only in 28{\%} of LTV (light truck vehicle)-adult crashes. Being thrown forward or knocked down were the most common (65{\%}) type of pedestrian-vehicle interactions for LTV-adult crashes. For children, 93{\%} of those struck by LTVs and 46{\%} of those struck by PVs were thrown forward or knocked down. For adults, LTVs were more likely than PVs to cause thorax (37{\%} vs. 20{\%}) and abdomen injuries (33{\%} vs. 18{\%}). For children, LTVs were more likely than PVs to cause injuries to the upper extremity (71{\%} vs. 56{\%}) and abdomen (14{\%} vs. 8{\%}). For adults struck by PVs the most common sources of injury were windshield for head injuries (63{\%}), hood surface for thorax (67{\%}), abdomen (58{\%}), spine (30{\%}), and upper extremity (36{\%}) injuries, and bumper for the lower extremity injuries (60{\%}). The leading causes of injury for adult-LTV crashes were ground for head (39{\%}) and upper extremity (37{\%}) injuries, hood edge for thorax (48{\%}) and abdomen (56{\%}) injuries, hood surface for spine injuries (36{\%}), and bumper for lower extremity injuries (45{\%}). For child-PV crashes, ground was the most common source of face (37{\%}) abdomen (83{\%}), spine (43{\%}), and upper extremity injuries (54{\%}). For children hit by LTVs, 52{\%} of face, 67{\%} of abdomen, 100{\%} of spine, and 60{\%} of upper extremity injuries were attributed to ground contacts. Altogether, the major sources of injury were hood surface and windshield for PV-pedestrian crashes and hood surface and hood edge for LTV-pedestrian crashes. Changes in design, such as altering the geometry and stiffness of front-end structures, might be associated with considerable decrease in the frequency and severity of pedestrian injury.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Presumed effects of global warming on occupational heat stress aggravate conditions in many parts of the world, in particular in developing countries. In order to assess and evaluate conditions, heat stress must be described and measured correctly.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: Assessment of heat stress using internationally recognized methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Two such methods are wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT; ISO 7243) and predicted heat strain (PHS; ISO 7933). Both methods measure relevant climatic factors and provide recommendations for limit values in terms of time when heat stress becomes imminent. The WBGT as a heat stress index is empirical and widely recognized. It requires, however, special sensors for the climatic factors that can introduce significant measurement errors if prescriptions in ISO 7243 are not followed. The PHS (ISO 7933) is based on climatic factors that can easily be measured with traditional instruments. It evaluates the conditions for heat balance in a more rational way and it applies equally to all combinations of climates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Analyzing similar climatic conditions with WBGT and PHS indicates that WBGT provides a more conservative assessment philosophy that allows much shorter working time than predicted with PHS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: PHS prediction of physiological strain appears to fit better with published data from warm countries. Both methods should be used and validated more extensively worldwide in order to give reliable and accurate information about the actual heat stress.},

The establishment of threshold temperatures in all major rural regions of Victoria indicate that hot weather results in an increase in mortality in persons aged 65 years and older. This adds considerable strength to the argument that human populations are vulnerable to heat events regardless of location. Heat alerts can be issued through local health and welfare agencies, to increase awareness of 'hot' weather as a health hazard for elderly people by providing education campaigns involving local authorities based on these simple thresholds.},

abstract = {Cities are particularly prone to the effects of climate change. One way for cities to adapt is by enhancing their green infrastructure (GI) to mitigate the impacts of heat waves and flooding. While alternative GI design options exist, there are many unknowns regarding public support for the various options. This study aims to fill this gap by performing a socio-cultural valuation of urban GI for climate adaptation that encompasses multiple dimensions: people's notion of and concerns about climate impacts, the degree to which people acknowledge the benefits of GI to alleviate such impacts, and people's preferences for different GI measures, including their willingness to pay (WTP). Data were collected through photo-assisted face-to-face surveys (n??=??200) with residents in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and linked to GI GIS data. Respondents had a notion of and concerns about climate impacts, but did not necessarily acknowledge that GI may help tackle these issues. Yet, when residents were informed about the adaptation capacity of different GI measures, their preferences shifted towards the most effective options. There was no information effect, however, on people's WTP for GI, which was mostly related to income and ethnicity. Our study shows that economic valuation alone would miss nuances that socio-cultural valuation as applied in this paper can reveal. The method revealed preferences for particular adaptation designs, and assists in detecting why policy for climate adaptation may be hampered. Understanding people's views on climate impacts and adaptation options is crucial for prioritizing effective policy responses in the face of climate change.},

abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is useful as an information tool for the examination of alternative future scenarios for strategic planning. Developing a life cycle assessment for a large water and wastewater system involves making methodological decisions about the level of detail which is retained through different stages of the process. In this article we discuss a methodology tailored to strategic planning needs which retains a high degree of model segmentation in order to enhance modeling of a large, complex system. This is illustrated by a case study of Sydney Water, which is Australia's largest water service provider. A prospective LCA was carried out to examine the potential environmental impacts of Sydney Water's total operations in the year 2021. To our knowledge this is the first study to create an LCA model of an integrated water and wastewater system with this degree of complexity. A "base case" system model was constructed to represent current operating assets as augmented and upgraded to 2021. The base case results provided a basis for the comparison of alternative future scenarios and for conclusions to be drawn regarding potential environmental improvements. The scenarios can be roughly classified in two categories: (1) options which improve the environmental performance across all impact categories and (2) options which improve one indicator and worsen others. Overall environmental improvements are achieved in all categories by the scenarios examining increased demand management, energy efficiency, energy generation, and additional energy recovery from biosolids. The scenarios which examined desalination of seawater and the upgrades of major coastal sewage treatment plants to secondary and tertiary treatment produced an improvement in one environmental indicator but deteriorations in all the other impact categories, indicating the environmental tradeoffs within the system. The desalination scenario produced a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to coal-fired electricity generation for a small increase in water supply. Assessment of a greenfield scenario incorporating water demand management, on-site treatment, local irrigation, and centralized biosolids treatment indicates significant environmental improvements are possible relative to the assessment of a conventional system of corresponding scale.},

Types 1 and 2 are found in T. laurina and types 1 and 3 in L. confertus. We have determined chloroplast distribution in the leaf tissues by fluorescence microscopy to assess the basis for these colour patterns. In L. confertus, a layer of collenchyma underlies the adaxial epidermis, replaces the upper layer of palisade, and does not mask mutant inner tissues, concealed by the adaxial layer of palisade in type 2 leaves of T. laurina. The central colour patterns are explained on the basis of accepted paths of cell lineage in leaf development (protoderm green in all three types; hypodermal derivatives genetically green in 2 and 3; and subhypodermal cells chlorophyll-deficient in types 2 and 3). The cell lineages postulated are similar in both species and we show that the observations can be accounted for only by a shift in lineage path during leaf ontogeny. We conclude that some established concepts of leaf ontogeny require revision.},

abstract = {Objective: This study applied geospatial analysis to explore spatial trends in cycling-related injury in Melbourne, Australia, in order to identify an area where injury density was reducing against expectation. The crash characteristics and cycling environment of the identified area were examined to better understand factors related to cycling safety.Method: Two methods were used to examine spatial trends in cycling-related injury. Firstly, cycling injury density was calculated using a kernel density estimation method for the years 2000 to 2011. This was used to examine patterns in injury density across Melbourne over an extended time period. Secondly, absolute change in injury density was calculated between 2005 and 2011. From this, a geographical area presenting a reduced injury density was selected for a case study, and crash characteristics of the area were obtained for the observational period. This led to discussion on which changes to the cycling environment, if any, may be associated with the reduced injury rate.Results: Injury density in Melbourne had been progressively increasing between 2000 and 2011, with a nearly 3-fold increase in the peak injury density over that period. Decreases were observed in some locations between 2005 and 2011, and a geographical area to the southeast of Melbourne experienced a more significant decrease than others. This appeared to be associated with a combination of behavior and road infrastructure change, although a lack of data to verify change in cycling exposure prevented more definitive associations from being established.Conclusion: The apparent positive response of the injury rate to behavior and road infrastructure interventions is promising, yet the injury rate is unlikely to achieve the government's road safety target of 30{\%} reduction in serious injuries by 2022. Moreover, the number of injuries sustained at the most common crash location appears to be increasing. Further research is necessary to discern which specific features of the urban road infrastructure have an effect on the risk of injury to a cyclist and which combination of features is consistent with a safe cycling environment.},

abstract = {AbstractIn an urban setting, investments in bicycle and transit modes are expected to reduce automobile vehicle miles traveled. In reality, these benefits might be lower than expected if users simply shift between nonautomobile modes. This article investigates modal shifts among automobile, bus, and bicycle use in students commuting to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) in 2008 and 2012, when a few changes were made to the local transportation system. The authors found that a significant decline in automobile mode share was associated with a significant increase in bicycle mode share, suggesting that bicycling replaced certain automobile commuting trips. Analysis by distance revealed nuances in mode substitution. There were significant increases in bicycle commuting for students living between 1.6 and 15.9 km (1.0 and 9.9 miles) from campus. However, the increases in bicycling for students living between 1.6 and 3.1 km (1.0 and 1.9 miles) corresponded with decreases in bus rather than automobile ...},

abstract = {Modern residential land development has trended toward densification, resulting in limited space to plant shade trees. As a result, shade trees are often planted in sub-optimal locations around homes for energy conservation benefits. Using a simulation program called EnergyPlus, we examined the effects of existing trees on energy consumption of recently constructed homes in three U.S. cities with distinctly different climates: Metro Minneapolis, MN, Charlotte, NC, and Metro Orlando, FL. We used remote sensing to identify placement of existing trees around homes, revealing that there were 1.5 to 2.9 trees within 15m of the homes on average. When modeled as large-stature deciduous trees in the simulator, existing trees provided average annual energy savings per parcel of 14kWh (MN), 25kWh (NC), and 44kWh (FL). We then tested an alternative tree placement strategy that spatially reconfigured the existing trees, based on parcel orientation, to both minimize space conflicts and maximize energy savings. This alternative strategy optimized the placement of over 70{\%} of the existing trees and significantly improved annual energy savings per parcel to 57kWh (MN), 47kWh (NC), and 103kWh (FL). In Metro Orlando, the impact of optimization on annual energy savings across our sampling frame was 574,000kWh. Although our alternative strategy was no more effective than the conventional strategy (always plant a shade tree on the west aspect). It is more responsive to space constraints and therefore can guide developers and homeowners more practically toward optimal tree placement for energy conservation.},

abstract = {It has been argued that climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. The extreme high temperatures of the summer of 2003 were associated with up to seventy thousand excess deaths across Europe. Previous studies have attributed the meteorological event to the human influence on climate, or examined the role of heat waves on human health. Here, for the first time, we explicitly quantify the role of human activity on climate and heat-related mortality in an event attribution framework, analysing both the Europe-wide temperature response in 2003, and localised responses over London and Paris. Using publicly-donated computing, we perform many thousands of climate simulations of a high-resolution regional climate model. This allows generation of a comprehensive statistical description of the 2003 event and the role of human influence within it, using the results as input to a health impact assessment model of human mortality. We find large-scale dynamical modes of atmospheric variability remain largely unchanged under anthropogenic climate change, and hence the direct thermodynamical response is mainly responsible for the increased mortality. In summer 2003, anthropogenic climate change increased the risk of heat-related mortality in Central Paris by ∼70{\%} and by ∼20{\%} in London, which experienced lower extreme heat. Out of the estimated ∼315 and ∼735 summer deaths attributed to the heatwave event in Greater London and Central Paris, respectively, 64 (±3) deaths were attributable to anthropogenic climate change in London, and 506 (±51) in Paris. Such an ability to robustly attribute specific damages to anthropogenic drivers of increased extreme heat can inform societal responses to, and responsibilities for, climate change.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the development of a thermal design tool for use in planning outdoor spaces by combining a heat balance simulation for urban surfaces, including buildings, the ground and greenery, with a 3D-CAD system that can be run on a personal computer. The newly developed tool is constructed by improving the previous simulation model, which uses the geographic information system (GIS) for the input data. The simulation algorithm is constructed so as to predict the surface temperature distribution of urban blocks while taking into account the actual design of the outdoor space using the 3D-CAD system. A method of multi-tracing simulation to calculate the sky view factor and radiative heat transfer is established. The optimal mesh size is examined for the tool so as to provide detailed spatial geometry within a suitable calculation time. The simulation model is integrated with an all-purpose 3D-CAD software, and the pre-processing method are constructed for practical use. The results obtained by applying this simulation tool to an area of detached houses reveals that the tool is able to evaluate the effects of building shape, materials, and tree shade on the surface temperature distribution, as well as the MRT and HIP, which are evaluation indices of the outdoor thermal environment. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results demonstrated that patterns and functions of connectivity categories have changed greatly during urbanization. The increasing areas of edge, branch, and bridge resulted in cooling the environments. It showed that perforation is the best category to keep thermal environments stable by being surrounded with large green areas. By comparing the results of statistics and buffer analysis, islet, edge, bridge, and branch contributed to decreasing temperature of nongreen areas in surrounding areas. The findings can improve the understanding of relationship between urban green connectivity and its climate regulation function, and supply the evidence for urban planning and green-corridor planning.},

@article{Lehmann2014,
abstract = {Increasingly decision-makers and politicians are becoming aware of the importance of urban ecosystem services (ESS). This creates an opportunity to deal with recent challenges of urban development. However, questions remain on how to assess and manage these services as well as to transfer the opportunities which present themselves into planning procedures. Since urban planning is mainly about land use decisions, approaches are required that describe and evaluate ESS in relation to the typologies and procedures of urban planners. ESS depend on the structural parameters of urban green spaces. In order to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of these parameters, a method has been sought to enable the detailed identification of ESS on the basis of urban vegetation structures. The so-called urban vegetation structure type (UVST) approach is based on the mapping of urban biotope types as well as an analysis of terrestrial and aerial photographs. It enables the identification and description of all areas within a city characterized by vegetation according to type, size, structural characterization as well as density, structure and building type. The analysis of vegetation structures and the determination of patterns of greenery were realized for the map of the urban biotope types of the City of Dresden, Germany. This led to the identification of 57 UVSTs, distinguished in terms of the level of soil-sealing, structure and type of building as well as the structure and amount of vegetation. By applying these UVSTs, average values for the amount of green space, the green volume and the proportion of sealed surface for the entire city as well as for urban districts can be determined. This provides a solid basis upon which to investigate diverse ESS and assess the ecological quality of urban structures. Climate change models predict that average temperatures are to rise. As densely built-up urban areas are particularly affected by such warming effects, planners need to take account of climate data in urban planning processes. An analysis of micro-climatic effects is offered by this paper as an example for the application of the introduced approach, particularly aimed at illustrating the differences between various urban vegetation structures concerning their micro-climatic effects. Selected results of climate modelling are presented, confirming clear differences in the micro-climatic effects of several UVSTs, both at city and urban-district level. The UVST approach is also appropriate for case studies concerning the micro-climatic impact of changes in land use at the urban-district level. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated positive associations between the greenness of high school landscapes and school wide academic performance. We do not known, however, if green landscapes cause better performance or if the association between the two is a product of self-selection. If there is a causal relationship, the pathways through which green school landscapes affect student performance remain unclear. We hypothesize that views onto green landscapes help students recover from mental fatigue and stress. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment with 94 high school students at five high schools. Participants were randomly assigned to classrooms without windows or with windows that opened onto a built space or a green space. Participants engaged in typical classroom activities followed by a break in the classroom to which they were assigned. Attentional functioning was measured using Digit Span Forward and Backwards. Physiological stress levels were measured by skin conductance, body temperature, pNN50 (the proportion of the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 50 ms divided by the total number of NNs) and LF/HF (the ratio between low-frequency peak and high frequency peak). Results demonstrate that classroom views to green landscapes cause significantly better performance on tests of attention and increase student's recovery from stressful experiences. A lack of mediation effect demonstrates that attention restoration and stress recovery are two distinct processes. Implications for school site selection, design and renovation are discussed.},

RayMan has the character of a freely available radiation and human-bioclimate model. The aim of the RayMan model is to calculate radiation flux densities, sunshine duration, shadow spaces and thermo-physiologically relevant assessment indices using only a limited number of meteorological and other input data.

abstract = {Urban greenery is increasingly recognized as an important component of urban ecosystems as it provides a range of ecosystem services for environmental and human well-being. However, the extent to which the performance of urban greenery is affected by availability of light in high-density urban environment is poorly understood. We examined the effect of shade on the levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in different urban forms, focusing on urban street canyon, vehicular flyovers, sky terraces, at-grade community gardens and rooftop community gardens surrounded by high-rise residential buildings. Within these urban forms, we examined the effects of PAR levels on the growth of shrubs, trees and palms. PAR was assessed though simulation using the building information modeling tool Ecotect, and direct measurements with quantum sensors. PAR was most reduced in sky terraces, with daily PAR restricted to about 15 {\%} of unshaded conditions in Singapore. Daily PAR in rooftop community garden was about 60 {\%} of unshaded conditions, whereas urban street canyon, planting area around and under vehicular flyovers and at-grade community garden had daily PAR of 41 to 52 {\%} of unshaded conditions. Within these shaded environments, almost half of all shrubs and almost all flowering shrubs showed differences in vegetative and reproductive growth at lower PAR levels, respectively. Slenderness of trees was also significantly higher compared to trees grown in more unshaded conditions. The spatial distribution of PAR levels was highly non-uniform, with PAR differing between two and nine-fold within a site, and differed significantly to that of direct sunshine hours. These findings provide insights on how a better understanding of effects of shade on PAR helps to improve urban green space design and plant selection for better plant performance. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

@article{Fallis2013,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Hardgrove2016,
abstract = {There are frequent anecdotal recommendations for the use of locally produced spent coffee grounds in urban agriculture and gardens, either through direct soil application or after composting with other urban organic wastes. This study investigates the scientific basis for direct application of spent coffee grounds (SCG) and the influence of different: (i) plant pH and nitrogen preferences, (ii) soil types, and (iii) application rates. We specifically consider impacts upon plant growth, soil hydrology and nitrogen transformation processes. We grew five horticultural plants (broccoli, leek, radish, viola and sunflower) in sandy, sandy clay loam and loam soils, with and without SCG and fertilizer amendments. The same horticultural plants were grown in the field with 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 25{\%} SCG amendment rates. Plant biomass growth was related to soil pH, soil moisture, nitrogen concentration and net mineralization, as was weed growth after harvesting. All horticultural plants grew poorly in response to SCG, regardless of soil type and fertiliser addition. Increasing SCG amendment significantly increased soil water holding capacity, but also decreased horticultural plant growth and subsequent weed growth. There was evidence of nitrate immobilization with SCG amendment. Growth suppression was not explained by soil pH change, or nitrogen availability, so is more likely due to phytotoxic effects. Fresh SCG should not be used as a soil amendment in 'closed loop' urban food production systems without consideration of potential growth suppression. Further research is required to determine the optimal composting conditions for SCG and blends with other organic wastes.},

@article{Halper2015,
abstract = {We investigate whether public park amenities act as a substitute for outdoor water use by single-family residential (SFR) households in semi-arid Tucson, AZ, USA. Specifically we account for the effects of a park's proximity, size, and greenness (measured by NDVI), as well as the presence of a public swimming pool. SFR households with and without home pools are analyzed separately. We control for SFR property attributes, including house size, age, yard size and property NDVI. Results suggest that SFR outdoor water use is influenced by the conditions of all parks within an 8. km (5. mile) street distance. We also find significant differences between the "with" and "without" home pool groups. Households with pools used more outdoor water per square meter of house, per year of house age and per unit of NDVI. Households without pools appeared to reduce outdoor use in response to nearby small parks and increased park NDVI. "With pool" households had the opposite response: they appeared to increase outdoor water use in response to these variables. However, "with pool" households did reduce their outdoor water use in response to nearby public pools. Medium and large parks were associated with increased outdoor water use for both groups. We conclude that public green space and pools can substitute for private versions of these amenities, and if well designed, can contribute to water demand management and urban sustainability. This may be an avenue for addressing water supply shortages in semi-arid cities and other areas where populations are growing but water supplies are finite.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Objective This study analyzes environmental features that influence bicycle crashes within crash concentrated areas. This study particularly provides a systemic approach to analyzing major bicycle oriented facilities contributing to bicycle crashes within crash concentrated areas. Methods This study applies geographic information systems (GIS) to the identification of crash concentrated areas in Riverside County, California using five years of crash data as well as the development of environment feature data inventory. Based on the data inventory, a regression method was applied to discover whether there was a correlation between the presence of bicycle facilities and the occurrence of bicycle crashes. Results This study identifies that longer distance between crosswalks and bus stops are positively associated with bicyclist crashes, while structured medians contribute to the reduction of bicycle crashes. This study also suggests that parking lot entrance ways and parking lots with no physical barrier from sidewalks cause bicycle crashes on sidewalks. Conclusions This study presents guidelines for local transportation planners to analyze the patterns of bicyclist crashes in order to improve roadway safety. This research also assists planners in effectively allocating scarce resources as they address issues of bicyclist safety.},

abstract = {Existing procedures for the assessment of the thermal environment in the fields of public weather services, public health systems, precautionary planning, urban design, tourism and recreation and climate impact research exhibit significant shortcomings. This is most evident for simple (mostly two-parameter) indices, when comparing them to complete heat budget models developed since the 1960s. ISB Commission 6 took up the idea of developing a Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) based on the most advanced multi-node model of thermoregulation representing progress in science within the last three to four decades, both in thermo-physiological and heat exchange theory. Creating the essential research synergies for the development of UTCI required pooling the resources of multidisciplinary experts in the fields of thermal physiology, mathematical modelling, occupational medicine, meteorological data handling (in particular radiation modelling) and application development in a network. It was possible to extend the expertise of ISB Commission 6 substantially by COST (a European programme promoting Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action 730 so that finally over 45 scientists from 23 countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, several Europe countries, New Zealand, and the United States) worked together. The work was performed under the umbrella of the WMO Commission on Climatology (CCl). After extensive evaluations, Fiala's multi-node human physiology and thermal comfort model (FPC) was adopted for this study. The model was validated extensively, applying as yet unused data from other research groups, and extended for the purposes of the project. This model was coupled with a state-of-the-art clothing model taking into consideration behavioural adaptation of clothing insulation by the general urban population in response to actual environmental temperature. UTCI was then derived conceptually as an equivalent temperature (ET). Thus, for any combination of air temperature, wind, radiation, and humidity (stress), UTCI is defined as the isothermal air temperature of the reference condition that would elicit the same dynamic response (strain) of the physiological model. As UTCI is based on contemporary science its use will standardise applications in the major fields of human biometeorology, thus making research results comparable and physiologically relevant.},

abstract = {This study investigates the associations between quality of urban green spaces (UGS), self-reported physical activity (PA), and health indicators in Aydın, Turkey. Data was collected through a survey with 420 participants. The associations between quality of UGS, self-reported frequency and duration of PA, and stress, mental health, and physical health were examined with multivariate linear regression while controlling for confounding factors. Results showed that nearest distance to UGS and quality of UGS (i.e. maintenance and cleanliness) were associated with increased frequency of PA. Higher frequency of PA was related to less stress and better mental health and longer duration of PA was associated with better physical health. In addition, large and open/visible UGS were associated with better physical health. The findings also showed that stress mediates the relationship between PA and mental health. Results suggest that providing large, visible as well as clean and well-maintained UGS close to people's homes may be an effective strategy to improve PA and people's health.},

Extreme environmental heat can trigger the onset of acute conditions, including heat stroke and dehydration, as well as exacerbate a range of underlying illnesses. Consequently, in the absence of adaptation, the associated mortality and morbidity are expected to increase in a warming climate, particularly within the vulnerable populations of the elderly, children, those with chronic diseases, and people engaged in physical labour in noncooled environments. There is a need for further research to address the evidence needs of public health agencies in Australia. Building resilience to extreme heat events, especially for the most vulnerable groups, is a priority. Public health professionals and executives need to be aware of the very real and urgent need to act now.},

abstract = {The wet bulb globe temperature index (WBGT) is a common method to assess the environmental contribution to heat stress as part of an occupational exposure assessment. The two purposes of this study were (1) to compare empirical relationships of some meteorological conditions to WBGT, and (2) to evaluate a smaller globe and alternative method to assess natural wet bulb using a relative humidity sensor. Data were collected in six West-central Florida locations over multiple days for a total of 14 measurement days. Multiple linear regression was used to explore relationships relevant to the two purposes. It was clear that estimating WBGT directly from meteorological data or through estimates of the components of WBGT can be accomplished with a 95{\%} confidence of ± 2°C-WBGT. The 50 mm globe size is a reasonable approximation of the standard size (150 mm). The relative humidity method of the waterless natural wet bulb provides a very good estimation of natural wet bulb temperature. The determination of WBGT from the electronic instruments (small globe with or without the relative humidity method) provided a good estimate of the WBGT.},

abstract = {The transpirational cooling of vegetation as a measure to mitigate outdoor air temperatures was investigated for a street canyon in the city center of Arnhem, the Netherlands for the meteorological conditions of an afternoon hour on a hot summer day during a heat wave with wind of speed 5.1ms-1 at 10m above ground and direction along the canyon. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with locally applied vegetation in the street, i.e. avenue-trees, facade greening, roof greening and all three combined, were performed. The 3D steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were closed by the realizable k-?? turbulence model extended with source and sink terms to represent the effects of vegetation on air flow. By specifying a cooling power term in the energy equation, the transpirational cooling by vegetation was accounted for. The strongest cooling by a single vegetative measure was obtained with the avenue-trees with mean and maximum temperature reductions at pedestrian level of 0.43??C and 1.6??C, respectively. Facade greening resulted in rather small changes with mean and maximum reductions of 0.04??C and 0.3??C, respectively. For roof greening no noticeable reductions inside the canyon were found. In the case of a combination of all vegetative measures, cooling in terms of spatial distribution and intensity overall resembled a linear superposition of those of the vegetative measures solely applied with 0.52??C mean and 2.0??C maximum temperature reduction. Overall, the cooling was restricted to the vicinity of the vegetative measures, i.e. up to a distance of a few meters.},

abstract = {The carbon isotopic composition ($\delta$(13) C) of plant material has been used extensively as an indirect measure of carbon fixation per volume of water used. More recently, the $\delta$(13) C of phloem sap ($\delta$(13) C(phl) ) has been used as a surrogate measure of short-term, canopy scale $\delta$(13) C. Using a combination of $\delta$(13) C physiological, structural and chemical indices from leaves and phloem sap of Eucalyptus globulus at sites of contrasting water availability, we sought to identify short-term, canopy scale resource limitations. Results illustrate that $\delta$(13) C(phl) offers valid reflections of short-term, canopy scale values of leaf $\delta$(13) C and tree water status. Under conditions limited by water, leaf and phloem sap photoassimilates differ in (13) C abundance of a magnitude large enough to significantly influence predictions of water use efficiency. This pattern was not detected among trees with adequate water supply indicating fractionation into heterotrophic tissues that may be sensitive to plant water status. Trees employed a range of physiological, biochemical and structural adaptations to acclimate to resource limitation that differed among sites providing a useful context upon which to interpret patterns in $\delta$(13) C. Our results highlight that such easily characterized properties are ideal for use as minimally invasive tools to monitor growth and resilience of plants to variations in resource availability.},

It presents the subject in a progressive manner that is excellent for classroom use or self-study, and also provides an annotated reference to literature and research in the field. The foundations and methods for treating radiative heat transfer are developed in detail, and the methods are demonstrated and clarified by solving example problems. The examples are especially helpful for self-study. The treatment of spectral band properties of gases has been made current and the methods are described in detail and illustrated with examples. The combination of radiation with conduction and/or convection has been given more emphasis nad has been merged with results for radiation alone that serve as a limiting case; this increases practicality for energy transfer in translucent solids and fluids. A comprehensive catalog of configuration factors on the CD that is included with each book provides over 290 factors in algebraic or graphical form. Homework problems with answers are given in each chapter, and a detailed and carefully worked solution manual is available for instructors.},

abstract = {The aim of this research is to quantify the local impacts of tree volumes on the nocturnal urban heat island intensity (UHI). Volume of each individual tree is estimated through a 3D tree model dataset derived from LIDAR data and modelled with geospatial technology. Air temperature is measured on 103 different locations of the city on a relatively warm summer night. We tested an empirical model, using multi-linear regression analysis, to explain the contribution of tree volume to UHI while also taking into account urbanization degree and sky view factor at each location. We also explored the scale effect by testing variant radii for the aggregated tree volume to uncover the highest impact on UHI. The results of this study indicate that, in our case study area, tree volume has the highest impact on UHI within 40 m and that a one degree temperature reduction is predicted for an increase of 60,000 m3 tree canopy volume in this 40 m buffer. In addition, we present how geospatial technology is used in automating data extraction procedures to enable scalability (data availability for large extents) for efficient analysis of the UHI relation with urban elements.},

abstract = {The Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) model with variable canopy resistance was evaluated to estimate evapotranspiration (ETv) from a drip-irrigated Merlot (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard trained on a vertical shoot-positioned (VSP) system. This vineyard is located in the Talca Valley, Region del Maule, Chile (35??25??? LS; 71??32??? LW; 125 m a.s.l). The performance of the SW model was evaluated using the eddy-covariance method on a 30 min time interval. Also, sub-models to estimate net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G) were used in the SW model. A good agreement between observed and estimated values of Rn was found with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 33 W m-2 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24 W m-2. Also, the SW model was able to estimate latent heat flux with RMSE and MAE of 34 and 21 W m-2, respectively. On a daily basis, results indicate that the SW model was able to predict the ETv with RMSE and MAE values of 0.51 and 0.41 mm d-1, respectively. These results suggest that it is possible to directly estimate ETv over unstressed grapevines using meteorological data and soil moisture measurements. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Physical reduction of noise exposure is no longer considered the only preventive approach towards noise mitigation. Urban green spaces constitute an important factor in ameliorating the negative perception of noise in cities. The aim of this study was to explore the associations between several objective and self-rated indicators of interaction with green spaces and noise perception. In a small scale cross-sectional survey of residents of Plovdiv, Bulgaria we collected data on noise sensitivity (NS), noise annoyance (NA) and several green space variables. A conceptual mediation model in which the effects of green spaces on NA were hypothesized to be mediated through NS was tested. While most green space variables had significant indirect effects on NA, the only one having a significant total effect was distance to the nearest green space; that is, living closer to a green space was associated with lower NA. It seemed that while the other aspects of interaction with green spaces could reduce the susceptibility to noise, they could not do so for NA. In conclusion, interaction with green spaces had a beneficial impact on noise perception, but we still lack hard evidence regarding the mechanisms underlying these effects.},

@article{Beardsell2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sections leaves of Ficus rubiginosa 'Variegata' show that it is a chimera with a chlorophyll deficiency in the second layer of the leaf meristem (GWG structure). Like other Ficus species, it has a multiseriate epidermis on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf, formed by periclinal cell divisions as well as anticlinal divisions. The upper and lower laminae of the leaf often exhibit small dark and light green patches of tissue overlying internal leaf tissue. METHODS: The distribution of chlorophyll in transverse sections of typical leaves was determined by fluorescence microscopy. KEY RESULTS: Patches of dark and light green tissue which arise in the otherwise colourless palisade and spongy mesophyll tissue in the entire leaf are due to further cell divisions arising from the bundle sheath which is associated with major vascular bundles or from the green multiseriate epidermis. Leaves produced in winter exhibit more patches of green tissue than leaves which expand in mid-summer. Many leaves produced in summer have no spotting and appear like a typical GWG chimera. There is a strong relationship between the number of patches on the adaxial side of leaves and the number on the abaxial side, showing that the cell division in upper and lower layers of leaves is strongly coordinated. In both winter and summer, there are fewer patches on the abaxial side of leaves compared with the adaxial side, indicating that periclinal and anticlinal cell divisions from the outer meristematic layer are less frequent in the lower layers of leaf tissue. Most of the patches are small ({\textless}1 mm in longest dimension) and thus the cell divisions which form them occur late in leaf development. Leaves which exhibit large patches generally have them on both sides of the leaves. CONCLUSION: In this cultivar, the outer meristematic layer appears to form vascular bundle sheaths and associated internal leaf tissue in the entire leaf lamina.},

abstract = {Demographic shifts result in not only urban sprawl but also urban decay. Although urban vacant land is a sign of economic decline, it is beneficial to the improvement of urban ecology since it provides a variety of critical ecosystem services. It is unclear how socioeconomic/ecological drivers collectively affect the emergence and dynamics of vacant land within the urban context of population decrease and economic decline in different shrinking cities. To address this issue, this research performed comprehensive analyses to examine and quantify the impacts of social processes, economic conditions, urban ecological and spatial proximity factors on residential vacant land at both the block group level and the parcel level through incorporating high spatial resolution multispectral aerial photographs and GIS datasets. Results indicate three major conclusions. First, the mean lot NDVI is found to be a consistently effective measurement of residential landscape management behaviors at both levels, which is significantly and positively related to residential vacancy. Second, proximity factors indirectly and partially characterize a number of socioeconomic variables. Third, a ratio index called neighborhood vacancy prevalence was proposed to capture the neighborhood blight effect, and a potentially optimal neighborhood size was obtained among different neighborhood radii. By considering different categories of variables, residential vacancy can be explained and modeled adequately at both the aggregate and fine levels. Urban planners, geographers and social scientists could benefit from the explanatory and predictive model at the fine scale to yield the most updated parcel data with acceptable estimation accuracy for various practical applications.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study of mitigation of the heat island effect in the built environment with urban (city) parks. The park cooling island (PCI) effect, considering park grass cover and trees' density and age, is determined for selected extreme summer days at various wind speeds under the optimum soil water conditions in the root zone based on an all-day quasi-stationary thermal response. PCI was determined numerically by coupling a CFD model of an urban park and quasi-steady state, two-zone thermal response boundary condition models of each park element. The boundary models are evaluated in form of multi-parameter approximation polynomials taking into account the sensible and latent heat transfer and the geometrical, optical and thermal properties of park elements. Three-dimensional CFD modelling was used for the determination of temperature, humidity and air velocity fields in an urban park with a size of 140. m ?? 140. m. Based on the comparison of the measured and numerically determined air temperatures in the tree crowns, we proved that the method of linking the models is adequate for temperature and flow condition modelling in the city park environment. The results are presented in the form of local PCI as the difference between local air temperature in the pedestrian zone and the reference air temperature preceding the park. The study proved that it is possible to normalise the cooling effect using the specific dimensionless coefficient of leaf area (LAIsp), which includes an approximation of the density of trees planted in the park and their size or age. It was found out that the cooling effect of the park is up to -4.8??C at LAIsp, equal to 3.16, which corresponds to a planting density of 45 trees per hectare, with an age of 50 years. It was also found that with the length of the park cooling effect change decreases. The optimal length of the park with a LAIsp 3 is 130m. ?? 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {This study examines the climate impact of future urbanization on the urban heat island effect over one of the developing megacities in tropical Southeast Asia, the greater Ho Chi Minh City area, using a dynamical downscaling approach with a high-resolution regional climate model coupled to urban canopy model. Simulations incorporate different land use/cover and anthropogenic heat release data sets for the current and future periods, while the boundary condition was fixed in the current time to detect only the impact of urbanization. Furthermore, human thermal comfort due to changes in the thermal environment was examined by analyzing the temperature-humidity index. Simulated results show that the increase in the surface air temperature is approximately 0.22 °C in the preexisting urbanized area and approximately 0.41 °C in new highly urbanized areas. The main factor in these changes is conversion from agricultural or grassland to urban structures, which results in increased sensible heating and decreased latent heating. Simulated results also show that despite the increase in air temperature, there is no significant change in thermal comfort. This is because human comfort is not only determined by temperature alone, but also by relative humidity. Urbanization increases temperatures, but decreases evaporation, which then decreases the relative humidity.},

abstract = {Urban environments are expanding globally, and by 2050 nearly 70{\%} of the world's population will live in towns and cities, where opportunities to experience nature are more limited than in rural areas. This transition could have important implications for health and wellbeing given the diversity of benefits that nature delivers. Despite these issues, there is a lack of information on whether or how the experience of nature changes as green space becomes less available. We explore this question for residents of two case study cities of varying urban designs, sprawling (Brisbane, Australia) and compact (three English towns, U.K). Second, we examine how people's feelings of connection to nature (measured using the Nature Relatedness scale) vary across this same gradient of nature availability. Despite climatic and cultural differences we found substantial similarities between the two locations. Lower levels of neighbourhood tree cover were associated with a reduced frequency of visits to private and public green spaces, and a similar pattern was found for the duration of time spent in private and public green spaces for Brisbane. Residents of both urban areas showed similar levels of nature relatedness, and there was a weak but positive association between tree cover and Nature Relatedness. These results suggest that regardless of the style of urban design, maintaining the availability of nature close to home is a critical step to protect people's experiences of nature and their desire to seek out those experiences.},

@article{Wong2009,
abstract = {With the widespread realisation of the significance of climate change, urban communities are increasingly seeking to ensure resilience to future uncertainties in urban water supplies, yet change seems slow with many cities facing ongoing investment in the conventional approach. This is because transforming cities to more sustainable urban water cities, or to Water Sensitive Cities, requires a major overhaul of the hydro-social contract that underpins conventional approaches. This paper provides an overview of the emerging research and practice focused on system resilience and principles of sustainable urban water management Three key pillars that need to underpin the development and practice of a Water Sensitive City are proposed: (i) access to a diversity of water sources underpinned by a diversity of centralised and decentralised infrastructure; (ii) provision of ecosystem services for the built and natural environment; and (iii) socio-political capital for sustainability and water sensitive behaviours. While there is not one example in the world of a Water Sensitive City, there are cities that lead on distinct and varying attributes of the water sensitive approach and examples from Australia and Singapore are presented.},

@article{Lindberg2015,
abstract = {Urban green spaces (UGS), and more specific a higher number of facilities in UGS, have been positively associated with physical activity (PA). However, more detailed studies of which facilities generate high levels of PA, for which type of users, are relevant as existing knowledge is scarce and inconclusive. Using the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) we examined the PA levels during use of four different UGS and the use of 36 facilities. Semi structured qualitative interviews with the UGS architects were conducted to reveal the predetermined target groups of the facilities. Facilities that provide the opportunity for games and playing activities are more used for PA than facilities directed at individual training of strength and fitness. The opportunity for socializing and playing while being physically active seems important for many users. A variation in facilities arranged close to each other, as well as the design and quality of facilities, have an impact on use of facilities. Furthermore, males are more vigorously active than females when using facilities. Use of some facilities did not match the predetermined target groups and esthetics was mentioned as a key factor when designing facilities. Our results provide important knowledge to architects, planners and policy makers when aiming at designing activity-promoting facilities in UGS. Future studies need to further investigate the use of facilities among specific target groups, particularly females, and make this information more accessible to planners and architects.},

abstract = {A variety of tools can be employed in support of environmental policy objectives, but achieving preferred outcomes also requires the cooperation of private landholders and others with vested interests in the land. The Land Stewardship project in the state of Victoria, Australia, is an initiative devoted to exploring the ways in which private landholders could be encouraged towards more sustainable land management. Following the view that the success of policy initiatives is contingent on effective stakeholder engagement, a component of the Land Stewardship project involved a dialogue with landholders about policy tools (e.g., regulation, economic instruments) that might be deployed to encourage improved land management practices. This paper provides an account of the views and attitudes of landholders, as revealed in a series of three workshops, which consisted of discussions about the factors influencing agriculture, participants' interpretations of sustainability, and policy methods. The focus of the paper is on what landholders believe to be the strengths and limitations of standard policy tools, and the essential requirements for these tools to deliver the best land management outcomes. One of the main findings of the project was a 'preference hierarchy' in respect of policy methods, according to which the strongest support was expressed for voluntary and education-based tools, followed by market-based instruments, with command-and-control regulation identified as a measure of 'last resort'. In the paper we reflect also on how the views and outlook of landholders should be positioned relative to other inputs in the design of policy interventions.},

The impact of carbon dioxide was taken into account by changing the stomatal resistance and the leaf area index. Several climate change scenarios were used. Simulation studies showed that when the changes of a number of climatic and plant factors are considered, evapotranspiration responses can differ greatly from those that consider only temperature change. The temperature effect of the increase in CO-2 content in the atmosphere can be compensated by changes in the physiological parameters of vegetation. Thus, under certain conditions, one can expect a decrease in evapotranspiration instead of an increase such as is predicted by a number of models which neglect the direct effects of CO-2 on plant behaviour.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present and apply automatic algorithms to evaluate and improve non-stationary outdoor thermal comfort in urban areas. The effects of urban planning on thermal sensations are analyzed in three linear urban street designs and in non-linear arrangement of the streets with no vegetation in Novi Sad, Serbia. A temporal analysis is performed for extreme hot and cold days using universal thermal climate index (UTCI) simulations in the Grasshopper program. In future linear street design, the frequencies of the greatest thermal stress situations substantially decrease on hot summer days and slightly increase on cold winter days. Past, present, and future urban designs of linear street are compared, and the largest UTCI decreases are noted at 10, 17 and 18 UTC on hot summer days at 11 UTC on cold winter days. Future planed and proposed urban design of linear and non-linear streets is compared and the largest UTCI decreases are noted at 10 UTC on summer day and increases at 11 UTC in winter day. The building height and density increases in the future street design will modify the thermal environment. The proposed automatic algorithms are applicable for the analysis of human thermal comfort in various urban designs and climates.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effect of different high-albedo adaptation strategies on air temperature, mean radiant temperature and the Universal Temperature Climate Index (UTCI) for an idealized 2D street canyon. The used numerical model computes the heat transport in the canyon, and specifically takes into account the effect of multiple scattering of radiation. In general the mean radiant temperature has a much larger impact on the UTCI than the air temperature. Moreover, the mean radiant temperature exhibits strong spatial variations in the canyon due to its sensitivity to shading. The impact of albedo-differences on the UTCI is thus relatively small compared to the large shading effects. The best strategy to minimize the UTCI for the outdoor environment with building height to width ratio H/. W = 0.5 is found to be a uniform albedo of 0.2. For H/. W = 1.0, an albedo gradient from high at the bottom part to low at the top of the vertical walls showed the lowest UTCI. Although using high-albedo materials can mitigate the atmospheric urban heat island effect, it is very likely to increase pedestrian heat stress.},

abstract = {Actual evapotranspiration is a key process of hydrological cycle and a sole term that links land surface water balance and land surface energy balance. Evapotranspiration plays a key role in simulating hydrological effect of climate change, and a review of evapotranspira- tion estimation methods in hydrological models is of vital importance. This paper firstly summarizes the evapotranspiration estimation methods applied in hydrological models and then classifies them into the integrated converting methods and the classification gathering methods by their mechanism. Integrated converting methods are usually used in hydrological models and two differences exist among them: one is in the potential evaporation estimation methods, while the other in the function for defining relationship between potential evapora- tion and actual evapotranspiration. Due to the higher information requirements of the Pen- man-Monteith method and the existing data uncertainty, simplified empirical methods for calculating potential and actual evapotranspiration are widely used in hydrological models. Different evapotranspiration calculation methods are used depending on the complexity of the hydrological model, and importance and difficulty in the selection of the most suitable evapotranspiration methods is discussed. Finally, this paper points out the prospective de- velopment trends of the evapotranspiration estimating methods in hydrological modeling.},

abstract = {Bike sharing systems have been established in several cities across North America. An objective of all bike sharing programs is to maximize the number of trips to and from bike share stations. The purpose of this research is to identify correlates of bike station activity, with special emphases on the association of trips to and from bike stations with the number of nearby businesses and jobs. Using data on 2011 trips from Nice Ride stations in Minneapolis-St. Paul, 7 we introduce three ordinary least square regression models to evaluate the marginal effects of the presence of businesses on annual total station trips, trip origins and trip destinations. Our models include 19 variables in four general categories, including, in addition to the presence of different types of businesses and jobs, sociodemographic, built environment, and transportation infrastructure variables that are used as controls. Our result shows the number of trips at Nice 12 Ride stations is positively and significantly associated with food-related destinations near the station and job accessibility but not with general retail establishments. Use of bike share stations also is correlated with race, age, proximity to the central business district, proximity to water, accessibility to trails, and distance to other bike share stations. This research is important for planners, academics, and policymakers because the findings will facilitate the understanding of bike share operations, help planners locate new stations, evaluate the potential of implementing new bike share programs, assess economic activity associated with bike share trips, and 19 minimize costs of operations.},

@article{Pennycook2015,
abstract = {Although bullshit is common in everyday life and has attracted attention from philosophers, its reception (critical or ingen- uous) has not, to our knowledge, been subject to empirical investigation. Here we focus on pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure but no discernible meaning (e.g., “Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena”). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge bull- shit statements as profound was associated with a variety of conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style, supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., “A wet person does not fear the rain”) ormundane (e.g., “Newborn babies require constant attention”) statements. These results support the idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticismbut rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive sounding claims. Our re- sults also suggest that a bias toward accepting statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity.},

abstract = {Drawing on empirical research in London, this paper examines how public spaces in the contemporary city are shaped. Together, the ‘contexts', ‘processes' and ‘power relationships' that are revealed represent an integrated framework in the form of a journey through time during which contemporary public space—exemplified in this paper through the case of public space in London—is moulded. Extrapolating to the larger field of urban design, the discussion advances a theory of the urban design process as a place-shaping continuum. This urban design (or place-shaping) process, in all its complexity and variety, has the potential to anchor the field of urban design, offering a core for intellectual enquiry and policy/practice innovation. To situate this, the paper begins with a brief examination of urban design as a subject for investigation.},

It is designed to make the more numerical aspects of the subject accessible to plant and environmental science students, and will also provide a valuable reference source to practitioners and researchers in the field. The third edition of this widely recognised text has been completely revised and updated to take account of key developments in the field. Approximately half of the references are new to this edition and relevant online resources are also incorporated for the first time. The recent proliferation of molecular and genetic research on plants is related to whole plant responses, showing how these new approaches can advance our understanding of the biophysical interactions between plants and the atmosphere. Remote sensing technologies and their applications in the study of plant function are also covered in greater detail.},

@article{Nejati2016,
abstract = {Contact with nature has been found to produce multiple health benefits in diverse work environments. However, in healthcare workplaces, few studies have addressed this topic, and no studies were found comparing the restorative qualities of visual vs. physical access to the outdoors. This study used visual simulation methods to assess the restorative potential of specific design features in hospital staff break areas, investigating nature-related indoor decor, daylight, window views, and direct access to outdoor environments. The study hypothesized that staff would perceive break areas with higher levels of nature-based content as being more restorative, and that direct outdoor access would be rated as more restorative than window views. Two sets of visual assessments were developed and distributed as part of an online survey to members of the Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses in the United States; 958 completed responses were collected and analyzed. On a scale of 1-10, nurses evaluated the restorative qualities of (a) direct access to the outdoors through a balcony, (b) an outdoor view through a window, (c) a nature artwork, and (d) an indoor plant, all depicted on images of the same two staff break areas. Statistical analyses showed that ratings increased significantly based on higher levels of nature content, from no added amenities, to indoor plants, to nature artwork, to window views, to direct access to the outdoors through a balcony. This study supports the proposition that higher levels of access to nature, daylight, and outdoor environments are perceived to have significantly more restorative potential in healthcare workplaces.},

The system is divided into surface zones and gas zones, the number being dependent on the desired accuracy of the result. Direct-exchange factors are available for gas-gas, gas-surface, and surface-surface zone interchange. From these factors one can determine the net exchange factor for any zone pair, making due allowance for interaction with all other zones. The resultant factors are then fed into a set of energy balances, one on each zone, which by simultaneous solution permit a determination of the space distribution of gas and surface temperatures and the distribution of heat flux over the surfaces.},

Based on results, it is proposed that a city's stream metabolism and water quality may be regarded in a “Jekyll–Hyde” analogy, i.e., under dry conditions, this stream behaved much like a headwater system (Jekyll), but had far greater discharge as well as rapid swings in conductivity, turbidity, temperature, and oxygen concentrations during storm events (Hyde). Such dynamics could be damped by increasing soft, absorbent surfaces (green infrastructure) within the city.},

Urban underlying surface temperature value and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated using image interpreting and supervised classification technique by ERDAS IMAGE software using 1991 and 1999 Landsat TM images data. Reference to the relational standard of assessing human thermal comfort and other meteorology data of Hangzhou City in summer, air temperature and relative humidity variation of different land types of underlying surface were inversed. By choosing discomfort index as an indictor, the spatial distribution characteristic and the spatial variation degree of UHTC were estimated and mapped on a middle scale, that is, in six districts of Hangzhou. The main characteristics of UHTC spatial variation from 1991 to 1999 were revealed using a GIS-based calculation model. The variation mechanism were analyzed and discussed from the viewpoint of city planning, construction and environmental protection.},

abstract = {Trees along footpath zones (or verges) grow on the ???front-line??? of urban forest ecosystems, increasingly recognised as essential to the quality of human life in cities. Growing so close to where residents live, work and travel, these street trees require careful planning and active management in order to balance their benefits against risks, liabilities, impacts and costs. Securing support and investment for urban trees is tough and robust business cases begin with accurate information about the resource. Few studies have accounted for spatial heterogeneity within a single land-use type in analyses of structure and composition of street tree populations. Remotely sensed footpath tree canopy cover data was used as a basis for stratification of random sampling across residential suburbs in the study area of Brisbane, Australia. Analysis of field survey data collected in 2010 from 80 representative sample sites in 52 suburbs revealed street tree population (432,445??????26,293) and stocking level (78{\%}) estimates with low (6.08{\%}) sampling error. Results also suggest that this population was transitioning to low risk, small-medium sized species with unproven longevity that could limit the capacity of the Brisbane's Neighbourhood Shadeways planting program to expand from 35{\%} footpath tree canopy cover in 2010, to a target of a 50{\%} by 2031. This study advances the use of contemporary techniques for sampling extensive, unevenly distributed urban tree populations and the value of accurate resource knowledge to inform evidence-based planning and investment for urban forests.},

Spatial lag analyses were used to test the association of tree canopy coverage, measured through high-resolution aerial imagery, with rates of violent (murder, rape, robbery and assault), property (burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft and arson) and total (violent + property) crimes. Greater tree canopy coverage was associated with lower rates of violent, property and total crime, independent of block group level educational attainment, median household income, racial/ethnic composition, population density, vacancies and renter-occupied housing, as well as spatial autocorrelation. Results support the general findings from studies conducted in larger cities, including Chicago, Portland, Baltimore and Philadelphia and points toward trees' crime prevention potential.},

@article{Vargo2012,
abstract = {Background: We investigate the association of different composite walkability measures with individual walk-ing behaviors to determine if multicomponent metrics of walkability are more useful for assessing the health impacts of the built environment than single component measures. Methods: We use a previously published composite walkability measure as well as a new measure that was designed to represent easier methods of combination and which includes 2 metrics obtained using Google data sources. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between walking behavior and walkability metrics. Results: Our results suggest that composite measures of walkability are more consistent predictors of walking behavior than single component measures. Furthermore, a walkability measure developed using free, publicly available data from Google was found to be nearly as effective in predicting walking outcomes as a walkability measure derived without such publicly and nationally available measures. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of free and locally relevant data for assessing walkable environments. This facilitates the use of locally derived and adaptive tools for evaluating the health impacts of the built environment. Interest in the connections between land use and health has introduced new methods and tools for describ-ing health-related aspects of the built environment. 1 These methods often require a significant investment of time for training and data collection while yielding uncertain returns in terms of accuracy and strength of findings. For example, one instrument for assessing the importance of parks to physical activity incorporates more than 600 attributes. 2 A second widely used metric for assessing built form and physical activity is a sprawl index developed by Ewing, et al, which requires for its computation 22 separate measures combined through principal components analyses. 3 If built environment and physical activity frameworks are to be useful beyond the limited geographic and temporal extents for which they are often developed, these tools will need to be more readily accessible to a wide range of public health and planning researchers and practitioners. Efficient use of these tools requires that they be less methodologically complex and resource-intensive. Instead, if possible, they should be based on free and easily accessible data sources. This research assesses the relative utility of alterna-tive metrics for measuring the built environment. We seek to determine whether the integration of 2 or more built environment indicators into multicomponent or composite measures of neighborhood " walkability " yield greater predictive power for walking outcomes than single component metrics. Specifically, we test the predictive power of both composite and single component variables in explaining walking behavior in different neighborhoods of the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. In addition, we evaluate the predictive power of built environment measures developed from open access data to assess the potential for such increasingly available datasets to be employed in planning and public health research and practice.},

The indoor thermal performance of five residential buildings was then simulated using a building simulation tool with the local meso-climates associated with various urban vegetation schemes. Simulation results suggest that average seasonal summer temperatures can be reduced in the range of around 0.5 and 2 ??C if the city were replaced by vegetated suburbs and parklands, respectively. With the limited buildings and local meso-climates investigated in this study, around 5-28{\%} and 37-99{\%} reduction in heat related mortality rate have been estimated by doubling the city's vegetation coverage and transforming the city into parklands respectively.

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) of irrigated urban plants is a large yet uncertain component of urban water budgets in semi-arid regions. A detailed understanding of plot-scale ET and its sensitivity to plant species composition is necessary to improve estimates of urban water vapour fluxes and water balance. We used portable enclosed chambers and empirical equations to quantify ET from (1) unshaded urban lawns covered exclusively by turfgrass and (2) urban lawns comprised of open-grown trees and turfgrass groundcover in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area. Turfgrass at all locations had a non-limiting supply of soil water because of regular sprinkler irrigation. ET of irrigated turfgrass reached a maximum of 10. 4 ± 1{\textperiodcentered}3 mm d−1 and was always higher than plot-scale tree transpiration, which did not exceed 1 mm d−1. In summer, total plot ET of the lawns with trees was lower than lawns without trees by 0{\textperiodcentered}9–3{\textperiodcentered}9 mm d−1. Turfgrass ET was highly sensitive to solar radiation, and the ratio of ET of lawns with trees to ET of lawns without trees decreased with tree canopy cover. Hence, reductions in turfgrass ET caused by shading effects of open-grown trees were more important in influencing total landscape ET than the addition of tree transpiration. This suggests that low-density planting of trees that partially shade irrigated urban lawns may be a water-saving measure in semi-arid irrigated environments.},

abstract = {In data analysis, many situations arise where plotting and visualization are helpful or an absolute requirement for understanding. There are many techniques of plotting data/parameters/residuals. These have to be understood and visualization has to be made clearly and interpreted correctly. In this paper the classical favourites in chemometrics, scatter plots, are looked into more deeply and some criticism based on recent literature references is formulated for situations of principal component analysis, PARAFAC three-way analysis and regression by partial least squares. Biplots are also afforded some attention. Examples from near-infrared spectroscopy are given as illustrations. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Urban forest managers must balance social, economic, and ecological goals through tree species selection and planting location. Ornamental trees are often popular in tree planting programs for their aesthetic benefits, but studies find that they have lower survivability and growth compared to larger shade trees. To maximize ecosystem services within these aesthetic preferences, it is important to select species carefully based on their ability to grow in each particular climate. However, little locality-specific and species-specific data exist on urban trees in many regions. This study examines the growth, survival, and vigor of three common ornamental street trees in San Francisco's three different microclimate zones after over 16 years since planting. While we found over 70{\%} survival for all three species throughout the city, there were significant differences in health and vigor among microclimates for each species, likely due to differences in drought-tolerance. While Arbutus had the greatest proportion of healthy trees in the Fog Belt and Sun Belt zones, Prunus cerasifera had the greatest proportion in the Sun Belt, and Prunus serrulata had the greatest proportions in the Transition and the Sun Belt zones. This species-specific and climate-specific information will better equip urban foresters to target both planting and tree-care of these popular species appropriately to maximize the benefits provided by these street trees while still maintaining a diverse canopy. Finally, we argue that simple survival calculations can mask more complex differences in the health and ability of different urban tree species to provide ecosystem services.},

abstract = {The urban microclimate (UMC) can strongly affect the building energy demand. In this paper, the impact of the UMC on the space heating and cooling energy demand of buildings is analysed for typical office buildings in street canyon configurations, using detailed building energy simulations (BES). Convective aspects of the UMC are modelled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and data are transferred to BES, either by convective heat transfer coefficients or by directly coupling CFD and BES. Measured urban heat island intensities are additionally considered. Comparisons to stand-alone buildings show the large influence of the urban situation. We then outline multi-scale modelling concepts to consider UMC effects at larger urban scales, using a city energy simulation model and an adapted UMC model.

abstract = {Leaf Area Index (LAI) data are required to characterise evaporation and assimilation rates from canopies. The LAI of a canopy of trees can be estimated from the transmittance of radiation at various angles. A commercial sensor for LAI determination (Plant Canopy Analyzer LI-COR LAI-2000) was tested for olive trees (Olea europaea L.) during 1992 and 1993 in Cordoba, Spain. Plant leaf area of single olive trees was measured destructively and compared with indirect measurements with the PCA. A simulation model was constructed to test sampling strategies to determine plant area index (PAI) with the PCA in tree orchards. Plant areas and area densities of isolated olive trees in the field were accurately determined using the PCA. The PAI in arrays of young potted olive trees was also measured adequately. Measurements in an olive orchard and results of the simulation model of the PCA indicated that the PCA alone will underpredict PAI by around 30{\%} in olive orchards or arrays of trees with similar geometry. Accurate PAI determination may be obtained in some cases by using the PCA to calculate the PA of single trees. Alternatively, PAI may be calculated as the weighted average of the maximum and minimum values of PAI in the orchard using the ground cover as a weighting factor. PAI estimates will be very close to LAI in olive orchards as the fraction of total area corresponding to leaves exceeds 90{\%} in olive trees grown in the field.},

abstract = {Studies have demonstrated repeatedly that air pollution in Athens is associated with a small but statistically significant increase in mortality. Extremely high air temperatures can also cause excess mortality. This study investigated whether air pollution and air temperature have synergistic effects on excess mortality in Athens. Data concerning the increased number of deaths in July 1987 (when a major "heat wave" hit Greece) were compared to the deaths in July of the 6 previous years. This comparison revealed a greater increase in the number of deaths in Athens (97{\%}), compared to all other urban areas (33{\%}) and to all non-urban areas (27{\%}). Data on the daily levels of smoke, sulfur dioxide, and ozone; the number of deaths that occurred daily; and meteorological variables were collected for a 5-y period. The daily value of Thom's discomfort index was calculated. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate main and interactive effects of air temperature and Thom's discomfort index and air pollution indices. The daily number of deaths increased by more than 40 when the mean 24-h air temperature exceeded 30 degrees C. The main effects of an air pollution index are not statistically significant, but the interaction between high levels of air pollution and high temperature ({\textgreater} or = 30 degrees C) are statistically significant (p {\textless} .05) for sulfur dioxide and are suggestive (p {\textless} .20) for ozone and smoke. Similar results were obtained when the discomfort index was used, instead of temperature in the models.},

@article{Solomon2009,
abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO(2) concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO(2) concentrations exceeding approximately 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

abstract = {The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was conceived as a thermal index covering the whole climate range from heat to cold. This would be impossible without considering clothing as the interface between the person (here, the physiological model of thermoregulation) and the environment. It was decided to develop a clothing model for this application in which the following three factors were considered: (1) typical dressing behaviour in different temperatures, as observed in the field, resulting in a model of the distribution of clothing over the different body segments in relation to the ambient temperature, (2) the changes in clothing insulation and vapour resistance caused by wind and body movement, and (3) the change in wind speed in relation to the height above ground. The outcome was a clothing model that defines in detail the effective clothing insulation and vapour resistance for each of the thermo-physiological model's body segments over a wide range of climatic conditions. This paper details this model's conception and documents its definitions.},

abstract = {Studies on the thermal comfort of humans in urban areas require meteorological data such as air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and short- and long-wave fluxes. In such studies radiation fluxes can be expressed by the mean radiant temperature--a parameter with high variability in urban areas due to variability in global radiation. Wind speed in urban areas is influenced by urban obstacles and their orientation. Both mean radiant temperature and wind speed can be modified or changed by different height-to-width ratios or orientation of urban structures. Modifications to these parameters by typical urban structures (represented by the height-to-width ratio) can result in variation of mean radiant temperature over a range of more than 30°C, which can correspond to three levels of thermal stress. The results presented here provide a possible means of comparing different urban configurations in different climate regions.},

Pedestrian networks have enhanced the internal circulation of major catchment areas around activity centres and transportation interchanges. They have become an administratively and economically successful model in the absence of a democratic urban design process. By tracking the evolving concept of the grade-separated pedestrian networks in Hong Kong, the paper examines the evolution and institutionalization of such a spatial system. It argues that quantitative terms in urban design control cannot tackle environment quality as a complicated human experience and cultural phenomenon. The discussion further raises a concern about increasing public facilities manipulated by private enterprises and the city government as an active mediator in distributing spatial resources.},

abstract = {Ecological climatology is an interdisciplinary framework to understand the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems in the climate system. It examines the physical, chemical, and biological processes by which ecosystems affect and are affected by climate. The central theme is that terrestrial ecosystems, through their cycling of energy, water, chemical elements, and trace gases, are important determinants of climate. The coupling between climate and vegetation is explored at spatial scales from plant cells to global vegetation geography and at timescales of near instantaneous to millennia. Natural vegetation dynamics and human land use are shown to be important mechanisms of climate change. The boreal forest-tundra ecotone and the North African Sahel are examples of climate-ecosystem dynamics. Deforestation, desertification of drylands, cultivation of grasslands, reforestation following farm abandonment, and urbanization are case studies of how human uses of land alter climate. The book is written as an introductory textbook for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. It reviews the key scientific concepts, the field observations that support these concepts, and climate model applications that show the impact of vegetation on climate. To aid professors in lectures and to help students understand concepts, the book contains 409 illustrations, many in color. Each chapter begins with a chapter summary that provides readers a quick overview and an understanding of how the various chapters relate to one another. Each chapter includes review questions to aid students in their understanding and to allow them to monitor their comprehension of the material. Each chapter also contains a bibliography of the relevant literature, with 1,975 scientific studies cited in a state-of-the-art scientific review.},

abstract = {Quality of life in cities and towns is of increasing concern to the public, and to policymakers. A major threat to quality of life is the high volume of motor vehicle traffic, associated with a wide range of mental and physical health detriments arising from immediate, local impacts such as air and noise pollution, road deaths and injuries, as well as global, longer term effects, such as the destabilisation of Earth‟s climate. The article reports on an investigation into the impacts of traffic on quality of life in a residential area of Bristol (UK), a city which in the British context is particularly car dependent. In essence the study replicated Appleyard‟s (1969) research on traffic and neighbourhood social interaction. Primary data were collected through observations and a series of interviews with 60 households on three streets selected for their contrasting levels of traffic. The results confirmed that Appleyard‟s findings are applicable to the UK in the 21st century; specifically that the number of friends and acquaintances reported by residents was significantly lower on streets with higher volumes of motor traffic. The extent of people‟s „home territories‟ also diminished as motor traffic increased. Other notable outcomes from the research include the finding that individuals‟ perceptions of road safety in their neighbourhood may be disproportionately influenced by the traffic conditions on their street of residence, especially affecting the degree of independence granted to children. The findings are considered against the context of existing policy solutions to reduce traffic impacts, leading to the conclusion that the tools exist to reclaim urban residential neighbourhoods from traffic, but this will require considerable political will.},

This research used street accessibility audits and focus groups with vulnerable pedestrians and 100 completed on-street questionnaires to investigate attitudes and behaviour towards a shared space scheme in Hereford, UK. The findings have shown that despite being very positive towards the scheme, particularly in terms of aesthetics, pedestrians and vulnerable road users had a number of issues and concerns with the design and usability of Widemarsh Street, in particular nuances of design including the kerbs and vehicular access to the street.},

abstract = {In the U.S., the rise in motorized vehicle travel has contributed to serious societal, environmental, economic, and public health problems. These problems have increased the interest in encouraging non-motorized modes of travel (walking and bicycling). The current study contributes toward this objective by identifying and evaluating the importance of attributes influencing bicyclists' route choice preferences. Specifically, the paper examines a comprehensive set of attributes that influence bicycle route choice, including: (1) bicyclists' characteristics, (2) on-street parking, (3) bicycle facility type and amenities, (4) roadway physical characteristics, (5) roadway functional characteristics, and (6) roadway operational characteristics. The data used in the analysis is drawn from a web-based stated preference survey of Texas bicyclists. The results of the study emphasize the importance of a comprehensive evaluation of both route-related attributes and bicyclists' demographics in bicycle route choice decisions. The empirical results indicate that travel time (for commuters) and motorized traffic volume are the most important attributes in bicycle route choice. Other route attributes with a high impact include number of stop signs, red light, and cross-streets, speed limits, on-street parking characteristics, and whether there exists a continuous bicycle facility on the route.},

abstract = {This study elucidated the thermal effects of urban forests on physiological and psychological responses; changes in skin temperature, thermal sensation, and thermal preferences. The air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, and globe temperature were measured in an urban forest and a central building district (CBD) area. Changes in skin temperature were analyzed for 12 subjects in both areas. A total of 790 individuals were interviewed on the actual thermal comfort. The results showed that air temperature and outdoor standard effective temperature (OUT{\_}SET*) in the summer and autumn were higher at the CBD than at the urban forest area ( p {\textless} 0.01). In summer, the mean skin temperature was 35.0 °C at the CBD and 34.0 °C at the urban forest area, respectively. In autumn, it was 33.3 °C and 31.3 °C. During the summer, 60.3{\%} of participants felt hot sensation in the CBD (23.8{\%}, in the forest), while 79.3{\%} felt comfortable in the urban forest (31.1{\%}, in the CBD). The comfortable air temperature range in the urban forest area was 12.1 to 21.6 °C, it was broader than in the CBD. People in the urban forest area felt more comfortable than did those in the CBD. These findings suggest that urban forests increase thermal comfort and widen the comfortable temperature range. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Abstract In a previous work, we described a simple model for calculating direct normal and diffuse horizontal spectral solar irradiance for cloudless sky conditions. In this paper, we present a new simple model (SPCTRAL2) that incorporates improvements to the simple model approach and an algorithm for calculating spectral irradiance on tilted surfaces. The model was developed using comparisons with rigorous radiative transfer codes and limited outdoor measurements. SPCTRAL2 produces terrestrial spectra between 0.3 and 4.0 m with a resolution of approximately 10 nm. Inputs to the model include the solar zenith angle, the collector tilt angle, atmospheric turbidity, the amount of precipitable water vapor and ozone, surface pressure, and ground albedo. A major goal of this work is to provide researchers with the capability to calculate spectral irradiance for different atmospheric conditions and different solar collector geometries using microcomputers.},

@article{Walikewitz2015,
abstract = {The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is the most complex variable regarding the input parameters for heat balance models of human being that are the background for the assessment of thermally unfavourable conditions and heat stress. This paper investigates the simplification of past studies that the Tmrt is equal to the air temperature (Ta) under indoor conditions. In a second step, the causes for deviations between the two parameters are examined and integrated into the context of indoor climate. Measurements were conducted in four rooms at the Geography Department of Humboldt University in Berlin during autochthonal weather conditions from the 16th of August to the 2nd of September 2013. Tmrt was derived using integral radiation measurements and three different types of globe thermometers.The study indicates that the deviations between the different methods of obtaining Tmrt are negligible for indoor environments. The results show that the differences between Ta and Tmrt are negligible during most periods, as stated in previous literature. As air temperatures increase, however, Tmrt exceeds Ta up to 1.3K. The examination of the surface temperatures indicates that rooms with window walls facing southeast and southwest show the largest disparities between Ta and Tmrt. The correlation between Ta and Tmrt and the sum of the short and long wave radiation specifies the radiation intensity and duration as the main driver of Tmrt. Future studies on indoor heat stress should hence consider that Tmrt and Ta can differ depending on the characteristics of the room and on solar radiation.},

abstract = {The present study compared the physiological responses and the subsequent cognitive performance when riding an electrically assisted (EB) versus a classical (CB) bicycle. Oxygen uptake, heart rate and leg extensor muscles electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded in 10 subjects during a 30-min intermittent cycling exercise performed with EB versus CB. Cognitive performance was evaluated by a mail sorting test, performed at rest and after each cycling session. Averaged oxygen uptake and heat rate were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) lower during EB cycling than during CB cycling. The EMG activities of the vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius medialis muscles were significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) greater during CB cycling than during EB cycling. The time to complete the mail sorting test was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) shorter after EB cycling than after CB cycling. Because EB cycling reduced muscle strains and physiological stress, it might offer benefits for those using bicycles in their work, such as postal workers and police officers. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: This study compared physiological and cognitive responses when riding an electrically assisted versus a classical bicycle. The results showed that the electrically assisted bicycle led to reduced muscle strains and physiological stress and, therefore, might offer benefits for those using bicycles in their work, such as postal workers and police officers.},
